Identify the conclusion of the following argument. There are those who use predicate variables; the values of these variables are attributes. Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to. The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.

This question refers to the following information. Read the following memoir. Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: "I do not know him"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, "He is a man I never see"; and from these judgments there was no appeal. No one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance. He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence. —Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750 Which of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?Options: A. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.  B. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.  C. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.  D. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.
This question refers to the following information. In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&… "Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery." Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place. His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him: "Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place." émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885 A nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would probably be most interested inOptions: A. the Russian interest in French culture  B. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners  C. the sense of continual class struggle  D. the need for noblesse oblige
This question refers to the following information. Florence is more beautiful and five hundred forty years older than your Venice. … We have round about us thirty thousand estates, owned by nobleman and merchants, citizens and craftsman, yielding us yearly bread and meat, wine and oil, vegetables and cheese, hay and wood, to the value of nine thousand ducats in cash. … We have two trades greater than any four of yours in Venice put together—the trades wool and silk. … Our beautiful Florence contains within the city … two hundred seventy shops belonging to the wool merchant's guild, from whence their wares are sent to Rome and the Marches, Naples and Sicily, Constantinople … and the whole of Turkey. It contains also eighty-three rich and splendid warehouses of the silk merchant's guild. Benedetto Dei, "Letter to a Venetian," 1472 From the passage, one may argue that wealth in Renaissance Italy was measured inOptions: A. the size of landed estates  B. the number of estates owned by an individual  C. the monetary value of goods  D. the amount of gold held
This question refers to the following information. The pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas. Source 1 Indians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed. —Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493 Source 2 It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits. —Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542 Which of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?Options: A. De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.  B. Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.  C. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.  D. De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.

This question refers to the following information. The assumption by a government of the office of Reliever-general to the poor is necessarily forbidden by the principle that a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect. In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. … The poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence. Herbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851 From the passage, one may infer that Spencer advocated which social philosophy?Options: A. Utopian socialism  B. Social conservatism  C. Romanticism  D. Social Darwinism
This question refers to the following information. As with a Commander of the Army, or leader of any enterprise, so it is with the mistress of the house. Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path. Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family. Isabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861 From the passage, one may infer that the subject of Beeton's book wasOptions: A. the role of women in army regiments  B. the running of a school for domestic servants  C. the running of a school for girls  D. the role of a woman in running her own domestic household
This question refers to the following information. For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a "unique German path." And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the "normal path." Heinrich August Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West, Volume 1, 2006 From this passage, one may infer that the belief that Germany had a unique mission in historyOptions: A. resulted from Germany's defeat in World War II  B. was unaffected by Germany's defeat in World War II  C. was proven correct by Germany's defeat in World War II  D. was discredited by Germany's defeat in World War II
This question refers to the following information. At last it seems to me that I have come to understand why man is the most fortunate of all creatures and consequently worthy of all admiration. … The nature of all other beings is limited. … Imagine! The great generosity of God! The happiness of man! To man it is allowed to be whatever he chooses to be! Pico della Mirandola, Oration on the Dignity of Man, 1486 From the passage, one may infer that Pico was participating in which cultural movement?Options: A. The Renaissance  B. The Reformation  C. The Scientific Revolution  D. The Enlightenment
This question refers to the following information. As a Jew, I have never believed in collective guilt. Only the guilty were guilty. Children of killers are not killers but children. I have neither the desire nor the authority to judge today's generation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the generation of Hitler. But we may—and we must—hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past. And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living. We remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory. Elie Wiesel, "Reflections of a Survivor," 1987 From the passage, one may infer that Wiesel believed that the current generation of GermansOptions: A. shared their ancestors' guilt for the Holocaust  B. had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust  C. shared in the responsibility for the Holocaust  D. had no responsibility where the Holocaust was concerned

This question refers to the following information. The following entries are in the diary of Napoleon Bonaparte. Paris has a short memory. If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798) If the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799) The presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army.

(diary, 1801) My power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802) The revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever.

Placing his relatives on foreign thrones  B. Changing the criminal code of France  C. Financial mismanagement  D. Curtailment of citizens' rights
This question refers to the following information. "The substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle was hastened by contact with Byzantine scholarship. Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&…The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value." Bertrand Russell, British philosopher, History of Western Philosophy, 1946 It can be inferred from the passage that the Council of FerreraOptions: A. laid the foundation for the Florentine Academy  B. permanently reconciled the differences between the Eastern and Western churches  C. accelerated the rediscovery of classical philosophy in Western Europe  D. allowed the Byzantines to learn from Florentine scholarship

This question refers to the following information. Read the following quote. I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . . Such are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe. —Galileo Galilei, 1610 Which of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?Options: A. Nicolaus Copernicus  B. Johannes Kepler  C. Galileo Galilei  D. Josef Pilsudski

Take up the White Man's burden— The savage wars of peace— Fill full the mouth of Famine And bid the sickness cease; And when your goal is nearest The end for others sought… Watch sloth and heathen Folly Bring all your hopes to naught. Rudyard Kipling, The White Man's Burden, 1899 The poem describes which kind of attitude toward the native peoples who were under the rule or influence of the British Empire?Options: A. They are "exiled sons" of the British race.  B. While "savage," they fight wars for the sake of a lasting peace.  C. They are ready for conversion to Christianity.  D. They are the product of a less-civilized and less-developed civilization.
This question refers to the following information. I am of opinion that the principal and true profession of the Courtier ought to be that of arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. . . . I would have him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit a man of war; whereof I think the first should be to handle every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those weapons that are ordinarily used among gentlemen. . . . Our Courtier then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . . I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . . You must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . . I wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it. —From Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, 1528 Which of the following themes of the Renaissance era is the above writing most connected to?Options: A. Secularism  B. Individualism  C. Humanism  D. Perspective
This question refers to the following information. Read the following excerpt. The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators. The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society. Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . . Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it. Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict. Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians. Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society. —Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820 The final result of the negotiations led by Metternich during the Congress of Vienna is being referenced in the document above in which of the following ways?Options: A.

Metternich's statement about fulfilling duties indicated his support for the Holy Alliance that controlled the fate of Europe.  C. Metternich's statement about the unity of monarchs alludes to the creation of the Concert of Europe.  D. Metternich's disgust for secret societies led to the creation of the Carlsbad Decrees.
This question refers to the following information. Read the the following quotation to answer questions. 1848 was the decisive year of German, and so of European, history: it recapitulated Germany's past and inspired Germany's future. … Never has there been a revolution so inspired by a limitless faith in the power of ideas; never has a revolution so discredited the power of ideas in its result. The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848. A. J. P. Taylor, The Course of German History, 1945 From the quotation, one may infer that Taylor argues that the most important effect of the political revolutions of 1848 wasOptions: A. the failure to bring about a change in the ruling class  B. the demonstration of the power of ideas  C. the discrediting of both conservative and liberal political ideology  D. the creation of the idea of a modern police force

A historian writing at the end of World War II might be inclined to look for, and find, the origins of perceived German belligerence.  B. A historian writing in 1945 would be dead now, and therefore, his analysis is irrelevant.  C. Historical analysis written in 1945 is "out of date," and one should look for a more recent book.  D. A historian writing at the end of World War II would be looking for the origins of the Cold War.

This question refers to the following information. In order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible, I have translated the term "Protoplasm," which is the scientific name of the substance of which I am about to speak, by the words "the physical basis of life." I suppose that, to many, the idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis, or matter, of life may be novel—so widely spread is the conception of life as something which works through matter. … Thus the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter. Thomas Henry Huxley, "The Physical Basis of Life," 1868 From the passage, one may infer that Huxley's view is representative of the nineteenth-century ideology known asOptions: A. anarchism  B. materialism  C. conservatism  D. romanticism
This question refers to the following information. Under the name of Chartist well-meaning inconsiderate men and other misled men have in very many cases, all over the country from the extreme west to the extreme east and from Brighton in the south to nearly the extreme north of Scotland, denounced every man who is not a working man, applied to him, the grossest epithets and most atrocious intentions and conduct, have threatened them with vengeance and in some places, have proposed plans for the seizure and division of their property—numbers of misled men and others of bad character, under the self-denomination of Chartists have gone from place to place and in the most violent manner disturbed and dispersed meetings of various kinds. Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words—they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms—and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people. —Excerpt of a letter from British social reformer Francis Place, written in 1842 The primary goal of the Chartist movement was which of the following?Options: A. Universal suffrage  B. Universal male suffrage  C. Universal health care  D. Social security and unemployment insurance
This question refers to the following information. For the catastrophe of 1914 the Germans are responsible. … Germany, in this matter, was unfortunate enough to allow herself (in spite of her skill at dissimulation) to be betrayed into an excess of candour by her characteristic tendency to go to extremes. Deutschland über alles. Germany above everything! … There you have the ultimate framework of an old but childish race.

This question refers to the following information. About the year 1645, while I lived in London … I had the opportunity of being acquainted with diverse worthy persons, inquisitive into natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning; and particularly of what has been called the "New Philosophy" or "Experimental Philosophy." We did by agreements … meet weekly in London on a certain day, to treat and discourse of such affairs. … Our business was (precluding matters of theology and state affairs), to discourse and consider of Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related thereunto: as physic, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments; with the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad. We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. … We barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.

This question refers to the following information. Confidential—For Your Excellency's personal information and guidance The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador yesterday delivered to the [German] Emperor [Wilhelm II] a confidential personal letter from the Emperor Francis Joseph [of Austria-Hungary], which depicts the present situation from the Austro-Hungarian point of view, and describes the measures which Vienna has in view. A copy is now being forwarded to Your Excellency. … His Majesty desires to say that he is not blind to the danger which threatens Austria-Hungary and thus the Triple Alliance as a result of the Russian and Serbian Pan-Slavic agitation. … His Majesty will, furthermore, make an effort at Bucharest, according to the wishes of the Emperor Franz Joseph, to influence King Carol to the fulfilment of the duties of his alliance, to the renunciation of Serbia, and to the suppression of the Rumanian agitations directed against Austria-Hungary. Finally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria-Hungary and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence. The Emperor Franz Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship. Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg (chancellor of Germany), telegram to the German ambassador at Vienna, July 6, 1914 From the passage, one may infer that Bethmann-Hollweg's telegram is often referred to as Germany's "blank check" becauseOptions: A. it pledged Germany to join the Triple Alliance and support Austria-Hungary against the Triple Entente  B. it was understood to give Austria an unlimited scope of response to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, to Serbia, and Pan-Slavism within the Austro-Hungarian Empire  C. it pledged Germany's unlimited support to Franz Joseph in his efforts to succeed the recently assassinated Franz Ferdinand  D. it offered nothing in terms of real support to Franz Joseph and Austria-Hungary
This question refers to the following information. Read the following memoir. Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: "I do not know him"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, "He is a man I never see"; and from these judgments there was no appeal. No one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance. He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence. —Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750 Louis XIV was aided by many able advisors, but which of the following advisors helped him to reorganize France and make it into a world power?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles. … The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848 The Communist Manifesto can be understood as an example of the influence of which mode of modern European thinking?Options: A. The Oxford Movement  B. Materialism and economic determinism  C. Hegelian idealism  D. The rationalism of the Scottish Enlightenment
This question refers to the following information. "A specter is haunting Europe-the specter of Communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies. Two things result from this fact. I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power. II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself." Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848 By 1917, which idea in this pamphlet had become a reality in Russia?Options: A. The avoidance of entangling foreign alliances  B. The violent overthrow of the bourgeois by the proletariat  C. The establishment of a powerful Russian Parliament  D. The adoption of free education for all children in public schools

This question refers to the following information. Read the documents below. Source 1 If then by the Use of Machines, the Manufacture of Cotton, an Article which we import, and are supplied with from other Countries, and which can everywhere be procured on equal Terms, has met with such amazing Success, may not greater Advantages be reasonably expected from cultivating to the utmost the Manufacture of Wool, the Produce of our own Island, an Article in Demand in all Countries, almost the universal Clothing of Mankind? In the Manufacture of Woollens, the Scribbling Mill, the Spinning Frame, and the Fly Shuttle, have reduced manual Labour nearly One third, and each of them at its-first Introduction carried an Alarm to the Work People, yet each has contributed to advance the Wages and to increase the Trade, so that if an Attempt was now made to deprive us of the Use of them, there is no Doubt, but every Person engaged in the Business, would exert himself to defend them. —Statement by the Cloth Merchants of Leeds, 1791 Source 2 Come, cropper lads of high renown, Who love to drink good ale that's brown, And strike each haughty tyrant down, With hatchet, pike, and gun! Oh, the cropper lads for me, The gallant lads for me, Who with lusty stroke, The shear frames broke, The cropper lads for me! What though the specials still advance, And soldiers nightly round us prance; The cropper lads still lead the dance, With hatchet, pike, and gun! Oh, the cropper lads for me, The gallant lads for me, Who with lusty stroke The shear frames broke, The cropper lads for me! —Luddite Song, The Cropper's Song, c. 1812 Which of the following best describes the governmental reactions to complaints such as those seen in Source 2 before 1850?Options: A.

The implementation of running water and sewers was begun in England.  D. The government created a national health-care system.
This question refers to the following information. "The substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle was hastened by contact with Byzantine scholarship. Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&…The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value." Bertrand Russell, British philosopher, History of Western Philosophy, 1946 The cultural diffusion described by Bertrand Russell most directly influenced the composition of which text?Options: A. Oration on the Dignity of Man  B. The Decameron  C. Handbook of the Christian Knight  D. Utopia

This question refers to the following information. Addison's Act had been conceived in the belief that, unless working-class aspirations were quickly met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia. By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, "having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half. —Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994 Which of the following attitudes prevalent after the First World War is evident in the passage above?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. Read the following quote. I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . . Such are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe. —Galileo Galilei, 1610 Which of the following is best demonstrated by the passage about intellectual thought at the time?Options: A. It led to better scientific tools, which led to a rise in the standard of living during the seventeenth century across Europe.  B. The ideas of the ancient Greeks guided all of their ideas.  C.

It provided experimental proof of the theories of ancient thinkers, such as Aristotle, on how the universe worked.
This question refers to the following information. As with a Commander of the Army, or leader of any enterprise, so it is with the mistress of the house. Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path. Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family. Isabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861 From the passage, one may infer that Beeton believed thatOptions: A. women held considerable power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life  B. women were denied power and responsibility in the public sphere of social life  C. women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life  D. women were denied power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life

This question refers to the following information. Perestroika [Restructuring] is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in our socialist society. This society is ripe for change. It has long been yearning for it. Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises. Mikhail Gorbachev, Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World, 1987 From the passage, one may infer that Gorbachev believed thatOptions: A. the problems that required perestroika were the fault of capitalist enemies of socialism  B. the problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society  C. a socialist society could not work  D. a socialist society could not coexist with capitalism
This question refers to the following information. The text below is the government proclamation. On the basis of the above-mentioned new arrangements, the serfs will receive in time the full rights of free rural inhabitants. The nobles, while retaining their property rights to all the lands belonging to them, grant the peasants perpetual use of their household plots in return for a specified obligation[; . . . the nobles] grant them a portion of arable land fixed by the said arrangements as well as other property. . . . While enjoying these land allotments, the peasants are obliged, in return, to fulfill obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this status, which is temporary, the peasants are temporarily bound. . . . [T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such acquisition of full ownership of land, the peasants will be freed from their obligations to the nobles for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners. WE have deemed it advisable: 3. To organize Peace Offices on the estates of the nobles, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes. 4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the peasants for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land. 6. Until that time, peasants and household serfs must be obedient towards their nobles, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations. 7. The nobles will continue to keep order on their estates, with the right of jurisdiction and of police, until the organization of cantons and of cantonal courts. —Alexander II, "The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia," Manifesto of February 19, 1861 Which of the following best describes the long-term effects of Tsar Alexander II's emancipation?Options: A. Food production soared, which allowed Russians to export agricultural goods while investing the profits into their industrial sector.  B. The program was a complete disaster as agricultural output plummeted until Pyotr Stolypin's reforms made privatized Russian farming profitable.  C. The emancipation terms relegated former serfs to communal farming, thus keeping them in perpetual poverty, and made wealthy conservatives nervous.  D. No longer tied to the land, former serfs moved to the cities, thus spurning the commencement of an industrial revolution in Russia.

This question refers to the following information. "After all the slaves had been brought together and severally marked with the letter G, the emperor's fifths and then Cortés' were deducted before we were aware of it; and, besides this, on the night preceding, the finest of the Indian females had been secretly set apart, so that when it came to a division among us soldiers, we found none left but old and ugly women&….Another soldier asked Cortés if the division he had made of the gold in Mexico was not a sufficient imposition, for, at first, he had merely spoken of 300,000 pesos, but when we were obliged to retreat from the city, it was estimated at 700,000 pesos. And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&… [Later], when Cortés learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cortés managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&…" The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568 The motivations described in the text are most similar to those of which explorer?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. The passage below is written by John Calvin. If we need to be recalled to the origin of election, to prove that we obtain salvation from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care. —John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559 Which of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?Options: A. Huguenots  B. Lutherans  C. Presbyterians  D. Anabaptists
This question refers to the following information. "After all the slaves had been brought together and severally marked with the letter G, the emperor's fifths and then Cortés' were deducted before we were aware of it; and, besides this, on the night preceding, the finest of the Indian females had been secretly set apart, so that when it came to a division among us soldiers, we found none left but old and ugly women&….Another soldier asked Cortés if the division he had made of the gold in Mexico was not a sufficient imposition, for, at first, he had merely spoken of 300,000 pesos, but when we were obliged to retreat from the city, it was estimated at 700,000 pesos. And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&… [Later], when Cortés learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cortés managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&…" The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568 The encomienda system, which is described in the text and was used during the colonization of the Americas to regulate the indigenous people, was NOT ended by which of the following?Options: A. The protests of the Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor  B. The lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores  C. The Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly  D. An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas
This question refers to the following information. [T]he the end and measure of this power, when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all mankind in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and possessions, and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved, but a power to make law, and annex such penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. … Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.

This question refers to the following information. Read the excerpts below. This corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity. —John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545 The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others. —John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545 Which of the following justifications used by Protestant reformers such as Calvin is alluded to above?Options: A. They believed that their church should not be subordinate to the state.  B. The corruption of the Roman Catholic Church and its leaders meant that reform was needed.  C. Religion was used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs.  D. The concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works is supported.
This question refers to the following information. "In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity. Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes. Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all." Johan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924 What was the primary impact of "Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few"?Options: A. The populous demanded rights from the state.  B. People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.  C. Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.  D. European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.

This question refers to the following information. The following account of the Paris Exposition of 1889. "The opportunities to study the natural history of man in Paris during the Exposition, and especially in August, when the great Congresses and the French Association held their sessions, were unparalleled in the history of anthropology. At any time the French capital affords rare advantages to the anthropologist. The Musée and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the école d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the écoles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment." Otis T. Mason, American ethnologist and curator, 1889 The scientists described in the account of the Paris Exposition would have been most influenced by the work of which scientific pioneer?Options: A. Einstein  B. Planck  C. Nobel  D. Darwin
This question refers to the following information. The pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas. Source 1 Indians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed. —Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493 Source 2 It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits. —Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542 The free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the natives in which of the following ways?Options: A. Economic opportunities were reduced.  B. They were subjugated and destroyed.  C. Economic opportunities were created.  D. They were enriched through trade in agricultural goods.
This question refers to the following information. In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&… "Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery." Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place. His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him: "Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place." émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885 In European industry, the mining industry as discussed in the passage grew in importance following the invention ofOptions: A. the water frame  B. the spinning jenny  C. the steam engine  D. the internal combustion engine

Confidential—For Your Excellency's personal information and guidance The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador yesterday delivered to the [German] Emperor [Wilhelm II] a confidential personal letter from the Emperor Francis Joseph [of Austria-Hungary], which depicts the present situation from the Austro-Hungarian point of view, and describes the measures which Vienna has in view. A copy is now being forwarded to Your Excellency. … His Majesty desires to say that he is not blind to the danger which threatens Austria-Hungary and thus the Triple Alliance as a result of the Russian and Serbian Pan-Slavic agitation. … His Majesty will, furthermore, make an effort at Bucharest, according to the wishes of the Emperor Franz Joseph, to influence King Carol to the fulfilment of the duties of his alliance, to the renunciation of Serbia, and to the suppression of the Rumanian agitations directed against Austria-Hungary.

This question refers to the following information. Under the name of Chartist well-meaning inconsiderate men and other misled men have in very many cases, all over the country from the extreme west to the extreme east and from Brighton in the south to nearly the extreme north of Scotland, denounced every man who is not a working man, applied to him, the grossest epithets and most atrocious intentions and conduct, have threatened them with vengeance and in some places, have proposed plans for the seizure and division of their property—numbers of misled men and others of bad character, under the self-denomination of Chartists have gone from place to place and in the most violent manner disturbed and dispersed meetings of various kinds.

This question refers to the following information. The following excerpt is from a speech by Vladimir I. Lenin. The independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable. —Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928 What was the result of Stalin's attempt to fix this problem?Options: A. The Soviet Union saw steady growth in both industry and agriculture.  B. The Soviet Union saw steady growth in industry and a decline in agriculture.  C. The Soviet Union saw steady growth in agriculture but industrial production fell behind.  D. The Soviet Union saw steady decline in both industry and agriculture.

This question refers to the following information. The passage below is written by John Calvin. If we need to be recalled to the origin of election, to prove that we obtain salvation from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care. —John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559 Which of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?Options: A.

I had the culprit burned, explaining that the cause was his having killed that Indian and eaten him[,] which was prohibited by Your Majesty, and by me in Your Royal name. I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them. —Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521 Which of the following was NOT a result of the European conquest of the Americas realized by the end of the seventeenth century?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. Read the following quote. I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . . Such are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe. —Galileo Galilei, 1610 Which of the following intellectual hallmarks of the Renaissance seem most in conflict with the questioning of the ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle, through experimentation in natural philosophy?Options: A.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed. —Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493 Source 2 It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits. —Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542 The free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the Europeans in which of the following ways?Options: A. Economic opportunities were reduced.  B. They were subjugated and destroyed.  C. Economic opportunities were created.  D. They were enriched through trade in Native American slaves.
This question refers to the following information. The text below is the government proclamation. On the basis of the above-mentioned new arrangements, the serfs will receive in time the full rights of free rural inhabitants. The nobles, while retaining their property rights to all the lands belonging to them, grant the peasants perpetual use of their household plots in return for a specified obligation[; . . . the nobles] grant them a portion of arable land fixed by the said arrangements as well as other property. . . . While enjoying these land allotments, the peasants are obliged, in return, to fulfill obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this status, which is temporary, the peasants are temporarily bound. . . . [T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such acquisition of full ownership of land, the peasants will be freed from their obligations to the nobles for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners. WE have deemed it advisable: 3. To organize Peace Offices on the estates of the nobles, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes. 4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the peasants for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land. 6. Until that time, peasants and household serfs must be obedient towards their nobles, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations. 7. The nobles will continue to keep order on their estates, with the right of jurisdiction and of police, until the organization of cantons and of cantonal courts. —Alexander II, "The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia," Manifesto of February 19, 1861 Which of the following best articulates the new conditions for the recently emancipated serfs of Russia as stated in the above passage?Options: A. The tsar's manifesto allowed for a heterogeneous class of farmers to emerge, with many former serfs becoming quite prosperous while others struggled.  B. The manifesto was mostly ineffective in improving the economic condition of former serfs, but paved the way for local self-rule and, soon after, a national legislature.  C. The tsar's insistence on cooperation between the nobility and recently emancipated people limited the financial potential of all impacted by the manifesto.  D. The manifesto, although emancipating the serfs, saddled them with financial responsibilities and other restrictions, while the aristocracy retained too many of their former rights.
This question refers to the following information. Read the the following quotation to answer questions. The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful. Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 1776–1788 The interpretation of the state of religious belief in ancient Rome by the eighteenth-century English historian Edward Gibbon might be offered as evidence forOptions: A. the clergy's monopoly on academic scholarship in eighteenth-century Britain  B. the hatred of all things Roman by British scholars in the eighteenth century  C. the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the eighteenth century  D. the lack of sources available to the eighteenth-century scholar for the study of ancient Roman civilization
This question refers to the following information. "The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. "Rome the capital of Italy" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&…. But the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department." Edward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885 The author laments the loss of which Roman traditions?Options: A. Lingual  B. Religious  C. Economic  D. Artistic
This question refers to the following information. From this moment until that in which the enemy shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic, all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the service of the armies. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic. … The Committee of Public Safety is charged to take all necessary measures to set up without delay an extraordinary manufacture of arms of every sort which corresponds with the ardor and energy of the French people. It is, accordingly, authorized to form all the establishments, factories, workshops, and mills which shall be deemed necessary for the carrying on of these works, as well as to put in requisition, within the entire extent of the Republic, the artists and workingmen who can contribute to their success. The representatives of the people sent out for the execution of the present law shall have the same authority in their respective districts, acting in concert with the Committee of Public Safety; they are invested with the unlimited powers assigned to the representatives of the people to the armies. The Levée en Masse, August 23, 1793 The passage can be used as one example of the way in which the Committee of Public SafetyOptions: A. revamped the economy of the new French Republic  B. successfully harnessed the human resources of the new French Republic  C. reformed the religious rituals of the Church in the new French Republic  D. brought about its own destruction
This question refers to the following information. "XI. As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences. XIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way. XXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&… XXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things." Francis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620 The method of inquiry elucidated by Francis Bacon in the passage is known asOptions: A. humanism  B. deduction  C. empiricism  D. scientific socialism
This question refers to the following information. The following excerpt is from a pamphlet. You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it. The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall. The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true. I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life. I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy. I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. —Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795 The document above supports which of the following demands of the Enlightenment philosophes?Options: A. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.  B. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.  C. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.  D. Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.
This question refers to the following information. Read the following excerpt. Never were talents of the highest genius of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction. —John S. C. Abbott, historian, Napoleon at St. Helena, 1855 Napoleon helped make the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conqueredOptions: A. By imposing a universal currency based on the French franc  B. By the brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance  C. By abolishing feudalism and manorialism  D. By encouraging the use of French as the universal language
This question refers to the following information. Perestroika [Restructuring] is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in our socialist society. This society is ripe for change. It has long been yearning for it. Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises. Mikhail Gorbachev, Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World, 1987 From the passage, one may infer that Gorbachev argued thatOptions: A. the need for perestroika had come upon Soviet society suddenly  B. the need for perestroika had been exaggerated  C. the need for perestroika was long in the making  D. the time for perestroika had passed
This question refers to the following information. ARTICLE I: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey for the one part, and Russia for the other part, declare that the state of war between them has ceased. They are resolved to live henceforth in peace and amity with one another. … ARTICLE III: The territories lying to the west of the line agreed upon by the contracting parties, which formerly belonged to Russia, will no longer be subject to Russian sovereignty; the line agreed upon is traced on the map submitted as an essential part of this treaty of peace. The exact fixation of the line will be established by a Russo-German commission. Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, March 14, 1918 The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk can best be described as the result ofOptions: A. the Bolsheviks' need to end the Russian war effort in order to consolidate their revolutionary gains  B. corruption on the part of Bolshevik leaders and collaboration with Russian business interests  C. the breaking up of the Triple Entente  D. French and British aid being given to the so-called White Russians who opposed the Bolshevik government
This question refers to the following information. The following account of the Paris Exposition of 1889. "The opportunities to study the natural history of man in Paris during the Exposition, and especially in August, when the great Congresses and the French Association held their sessions, were unparalleled in the history of anthropology. At any time the French capital affords rare advantages to the anthropologist. The Musée and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the école d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the écoles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment." Otis T. Mason, American ethnologist and curator, 1889 The field primarily described in this passage was born whenOptions: A. scientific societies needed new ways of attracting members who were less interested in the study of the natural world  B. there arose a sudden interest in expanding human rights throughout the French colonies  C. scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe  D. a large influx of immigrants from Africa and Asia arrived in Europe
This question refers to the following information. For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a "unique German path." And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the "normal path." Heinrich August Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West, Volume 1, 2006 From this passage, one may infer thatOptions: A. the notion of a unique German path in history has never been the prevailing public opinion in Germany  B. Winkler advocates a Marxist view of German history  C. there has been a longstanding debate in Germany about the existence of a unique German path in history  D. the question of a unique German path in history has been answered once and for all

Press Law So long as this decree shall remain in force no publication which appears in the form of daily issues, or as a serial not exceeding twenty sheets of printed matter, shall go to press in any state of the union without the previous knowledge and approval of the state officials. Writings which do not belong to one of the above-mentioned classes shall be treated according to the laws now in force, or which may be enacted, in the individual states of the union. . . . Each state of the union is responsible, not only to the state against which the offense is directly committed, but to the whole Confederation, for every publication appearing under its supervision in which the honor or security of other states is infringed or their constitution or administration attacked. . . . —Carlsbad Resolutions adopted by the Germanic States, 1819 Which of the following nineteenth-century figures would have been the LEAST likely to oppose those liberals described in the above decrees?Options: A.

In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High—the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere—its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood—of 'peace and good will amongst men.'"

This question refers to the following information. "We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment." Brown v. Board of Education, 1954 Desegregation of schools was, in part, a response to unfulfilled promises from which of the following initiatives?Options: A. The Great Society  B. The Square Deal  C. The New Deal  D. Reconstruction
This question refers to the following information. "Since the foundations of the American commonwealth were laid in colonial times over 300 years ago, vigorous complaint and more or less bitter persecution have been aimed at newcomers to our shores. Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The "Know-Nothings," lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day….But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers…..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst—a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War—Poland and Italy." Robert H. Clancy, Congressional Record, 68th Congress, 1st Session, 1924 Which one of the following legislative acts is most closely an example of nativism?Options: A. The Wagner Act of 1935  B. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798  C. The Espionage Act of 1917  D. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965
This question refers to the following information. Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."… We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today. We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.… We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program. —Senator Huey P.

Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor  D. Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy
This question refers to the following information. "Lincoln was strongly anti-slavery, but he was not an abolitionist or a Radical Republican and never claimed to be one. He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner." —Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010 How did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?Options: A. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.  B. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.  C. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.  D. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.
This question refers to the following information. "Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing…the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack….The attack yesterday…has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas….As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense." President Franklin D. Roosevelt, radio address, December 8, 1941 Which of the following statements best characterizes the economic consequences of the declaration of war described above?Options: A. Decreased trade with Asian nations precipitated economic recession in both the United States and Europe.  B. The war-ravaged condition of Asia and Europe allowed the United States to emerge as one of the most prosperous nations on Earth.  C. Cold War tensions isolated the economies of both the Soviet Union and the United States, leading to economic struggle for both nations.  D. Japan was subsequently required to pay reparations to the United States, forcing it into a prolonged depression.
This question refers to the following information. Tonight, the daughter of a woman whose highest goal was a future for her children talks to our nation's oldest political party about a future for us all. Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.… Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.… It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.… Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.… The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America. —Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984 The ideas expressed in the passage above would most directly have strengthened which of the following during the 1980s?Options: A. Opposition to the administration's arms buildup  B. Efforts to deregulate many industries  C. Efforts to reform the welfare system  D. Support for the administration's cold war policies
This question refers to the following information. Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to flounder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it—we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon, and the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.… We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. —John F. Kennedy, September 12, 1962 Kennedy's speech most directly led to which of the following?Options: A. The Vietnam War  B. The Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) nuclear strategy  C. The Apollo space program  D. The Great Society social programs
This question refers to the following information. The 1980s have been born in turmoil, strife, and change. This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills. At this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts—one of international terrorism and one of military aggression—present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.… Three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran. Each of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail. —Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980 The situation Carter described led most directly to which of the following?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. "We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from. "We found most people didn't even know the difference between communism and democracy. They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American." John Kerry, 1971 The conflict described above is most likely a result of which of the following doctrines?Options: A. Imperialism  B. Containment  C. Big-stick diplomacy  D. Isolationism

At a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: "Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members. —Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912 Settlement houses like Hull House expressed a desire of reformers to do which of the following?Options: A. Convert immigrants to Christianity  B. Prevent political radicalism  C. Provide cheap labor for industry  D. Improve conditions in urban neighborhoods
This question refers to the following information. "An act for the more effectual protection of the property of married women: "§1. The real property of any female who may hereafter marry, and which she shall own at the time of marriage, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, shall not be subject to the sole disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts, and shall continue her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female. "§2. The real and personal property, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, of any female now married, shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband; but shall be her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female, except so far as the same may be liable for the debts of her husband heretofore contracted.

This question refers to the following information. "We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires. "Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity." Populist Party Platform, 1892 Which one of the following political movements most closely shared many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party?Options: A. Progressivism of the early 1900s  B. Neoconservatism of the 1980s  C. Federalism of the late 1700s  D. Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s

This question refers to the following information. "The law of love, peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews, Turks and Egyptians, as they are considered sonnes of Adam, which is the glory of the outward state of Holland, soe love, peace and liberty, extending to all in Christ Jesus, condemns hatred, war and bondage. And because our Saviour sayeth it is impossible but that offences will come, but woe unto him by whom they cometh, our desire is not to offend one of his little ones, in whatsoever form, name or title hee appears in, whether Presbyterian, Independent, Baptist or Quaker, but shall be glad to see anything of God in any of them, desiring to doe unto all men as we desire all men should doe unto us, which is the true law both of Church and State; for our Saviour sayeth this is the law and the prophets. "Therefore if any of these said persons come in love unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free egresse and regresse unto our Town, and houses, as God shall persuade our consciences, for we are bounde by the law of God and man to doe good unto all men and evil to noe man. And this is according to the patent and charter of our Towne, given unto us in the name of the States General, which we are not willing to infringe, and violate, but shall houlde to our patent and shall remaine, your humble subjects, the inhabitants of Vlishing (Flushing, part of the colony of New Netherlands)." —The Flushing Remonstrance, 1657 Which of the following was most significant in enshrining into the U.S. legal structure the ideas contained in the Flushing Remonstrance?Options: A. The preamble of the Declaration of Independence.  B. The enumeration of congressional powers in the Constitution.  C. The "Free Exercise Clause" of the First Amendment.  D. The "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment.
This question refers to the following information. One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.… It is always the people who toil that pay. —Calvin Coolidge, "Economy in the Interest of All," June 30, 1924 The ideas expressed above were influenced by which of the following?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. "The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure. "This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place." Progressive Party Platform, 1912 In harmony with the sentiments of the excerpt above, which of the following best characterizes the "Square Deal" of Theodore Roosevelt?Options: A. Conservation, trust-busting, consumer protection  B. Protective tariffs, centralized banking, conservation  C. Equal opportunity, women's suffrage, laissez-faire economics  D. Laissez-faire economics, support of labor unions, conservation
This question refers to the following information. "The Opposition tells us that we ought not to govern a people without their consent. I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?…Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny." Albert J. Beveridge, "The March of the Flag," 1898 The sentiment expressed by Beveridge best exemplifies which of the following?Options: A. Imperialism  B. Anti-imperialism  C. Isolationism  D. Manifest Destiny
This question refers to the following information. It is natural, it is a privilege, I will go farther, it is a right, which all free men claim, that they are entitled to complain when they are hurt. They have a right publicly to remonstrate against the abuses of power in the strongest terms, to put their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or open violence of men in authority, and to assert with courage the sense they have of the blessings of liberty, the value they put upon it, and their resolution at all hazards to preserve it as one of the greatest blessings heaven can bestow.… But to conclude: The question before the Court and you, Gentlemen of the jury, is not of small or private concern. It is not the cause of one poor printer, nor of New York alone, which you are now trying. No! It may in its consequence affect every free man that lives under a British government on the main of America. It is the best cause. It is the cause of liberty. And I make no doubt but your upright conduct this day will not only entitle you to the love and esteem of your fellow citizens, but every man who prefers freedom to a life of slavery will bless and honor you as men who have baffled the attempt of tyranny, and by an impartial and uncorrupt verdict have laid a noble foundation for securing to ourselves, our posterity, and our neighbors, that to which nature and the laws of our country have given us a right to liberty of both exposing and opposing arbitrary power (in these parts of the world at least) by speaking and writing truth. —Andrew Hamilton, concluding argument, libel trial of newspaper editor John Peter Zenger, August 4, 1735 Andrew Hamilton assumes which of the following?Options: A.

Rights are granted by the government.
This question refers to the following information. Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."… We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today. We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.… We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program. —Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934 Senator Long ran a political machine that made him the virtual dictator of Louisiana. As a political boss, he can best be compared to whom?Options: A. George Washington  B. Theodore Roosevelt  C. William M. Tweed  D. Barack Obama
This question refers to the following information. "The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely." —President Harry S. Truman, 1947 The passage above can best be seen as providing a rationale forOptions: A. the policy of containment.  B. the principle of "massive retaliation."  C. participation in the Atlantic Charter.  D. embarking on a "roll-back" of communism.
This question refers to the following information. "One-half of the people of this nation to-day are utterly powerless to blot from the statute books an unjust law, or to write there a new and a just one. The women, dissatisfied as they are with this form of government, that enforces taxation without representation,—that compels them to obey laws to which they have never given their consent,—that imprisons and hangs them without a trial by a jury of their peers, that robs them, in marriage, of the custody of their own persons, wages and children,—are this half of the people left wholly at the mercy of the other half, in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this government, every one of which was based on the immutable principle of equal rights to all." —Susan B. Anthony, "I Stand Before You Under Indictment" (speech), 1873 Which of the following was NOT designed to empower the government to regulate the increasing wealth and power of the industrialists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries?Options: A. Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890).  B. Interstate Commerce Act (1887).  C. Federal Trade Commission Act (1914).  D. Newlands Reclamation Act (1902).
This question refers to the following information. I come not to urge personal claims, nor to seek individual benefits; I appear as the advocate of those who cannot plead their own cause; I come as the friend of those who are deserted, oppressed, and desolate. In the Providence of God, I am the voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses. I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures, hidden in your private dwellings, and in pens and cabins—shut out, cut off from all healing influences, from all mind-restoring cares.… Could their melancholy histories be spread before you as revealed to my grieved spirit during the last three months, how promptly, how earnestly would you search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling, how insignificant, by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to make; how would a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish in value as a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to be secured for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a sufficient fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.… —Dorothea Dix, Memorial Soliciting a State Hospital for the Protection and Cure of the Insane, Submitted to the General Assembly of North Carolina, November 1848 Which of the following best reflects the perspective of Dorothea Dix in the passage above?Options: A. The care of the mentally ill is a state concern.  B. The mentally ill are best left to the care of their families.  C. The federal government should regulate the treatment of the mentally ill.  D. More democracy will help the mentally ill.
This question refers to the following information. "In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantage—the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places." Frederick Douglass, 1857 In what way did the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 contradict Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above?Options: A. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.  B. Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.  C. Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.  D. Lincoln enacted the policy of giving newly freed slaves "forty acres and a mule."
This question refers to the following information. "A drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be. . . . The law of survival of the fittest was not made by man, and it cannot be abrogated by man. We can only, by interfering with it, produce the survival of the unfittest. . . . The millionaires are a product of natural selection, acting on the whole body of men to pick out those who can meet the requirement of certain work to be done. In this respect they are just like the great statesmen, or scientific men, or military men. It is because they are thus selected that wealth—both their own and that entrusted to them—aggregates under their hands. Let one of them make a mistake and see how quickly the concentration gives way to dispersion." —William Graham Sumner, What Social Classes Owe to Each Other, 1883 The sociological ideas of William Graham Sumner reflect the idea that during the late 1800sOptions: A. cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.

This question refers to the following information. "Whereas the laws and treaties of the United States, without interfering with the free expression of opinion and sympathy, or with the commercial manufacture or sale of arms or munitions of war, nevertheless impose upon all persons who may be within their territory and jurisdiction the duty of an impartial neutrality during the existence of the contest; And Whereas it is the duty of a neutral government not to permit or suffer the making of its waters subservient to the purposes of war; "Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America, in order to preserve the neutrality of the United States…do hereby declare and proclaim…. "That the statutes and the treaties of the United States and the law of nations alike require that no person, within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, shall take part, directly or indirectly, in the said wars, but shall remain at peace with all of the said belligerents, and shall maintain a strict and impartial neutrality…."

Bush's "A Thousand Points of Light"  C. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address  D. Franklin D. Roosevelt's "Day of Infamy"
This question refers to the following information. The 1980s have been born in turmoil, strife, and change. This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills. At this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts—one of international terrorism and one of military aggression—present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.… Three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran. Each of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail. —Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980 Which of the following best expresses Carter's approach to foreign policy in the passage above?Options: A. Isolationism  B. Appeasement  C. Containment  D. A call for war
This question refers to the following information. "We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment." Brown v. Board of Education, 1954 In which decision did the Supreme Court validate the practice of "separate but equal" facilities for blacks and whites?Options: A. Marbury v. Madison  B. Bradwell v. Illinois  C. Plessy v. Ferguson  D. Holden v. Hardy
This question refers to the following information. The man who mounted the steps of the Capitol, March 4, 1801, to claim the place of an equal between Pitt and Bonaparte, possessed a character which showed itself in acts; but person and manner can be known only by contemporaries, and the liveliest description was worth less than a moment of personal contact. Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.… His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and "The Palace" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they "lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied." —Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889 Thomas Jefferson's victory in the election of 1800 was important becauseOptions: A. he was the first southerner to become president.  B. it was the first time the presidency shifted from one political party to another.  C. he believed it was necessary to go to war with Great Britain.  D. he encouraged the rapid industrialization of the United States.

Woodrow Wilson, 1914 Which of the following statements about the Treaty of Versailles is true?Options: A. The United States Senate rejected it because it treated Germany too leniently.  B. The United States Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs.  C. The United States Senate approved it, with reservations concerning the division of Eastern Europe.  D. It was never voted on by the United States Senate.

An important incident in opposing British taxation policy  B. An early attack on the institution of slavery  C. A landmark case concerning voting rights  D. A landmark case concerning freedom of expression
This question refers to the following information. "I marvel not a little, right worshipful, that since the first discovery of America (which is now full four score and ten years), after so great conquests and plantings of the Spaniards and Portuguese there, that we of England could never have the grace to set fast footing in such fertile and temperate places as are left as yet unpossessed of them. But . . . I conceive great hope that the time approacheth and now is that we of England may share and part stakes [divide the prize] (if we will ourselves) both with the Spaniard and the Portuguese in part of America and other regions as yet undiscovered. "And surely if there were in us that desire to advance the honor of our country which ought to be in every good man, we would not all this while have [neglected] the possessing of these lands which of equity and right appertain unto us, as by the discourses that follow shall appear most plainly." —Richard Hakluyt, Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent, 1582 By following the ideas of Richard Hakluyt, England was eventually able toOptions: A. drive the French and Portuguese governments into bankruptcy.  B. conquer large parts of Africa in the eighteenth century.  C. establish several colonies along the Atlantic coastline of North America.  D. destroy the Dutch commercial empire.
This question refers to the following information. "I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. . . . Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . ." —Martin Luther King, Jr., "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," April 16, 1963 Which other nineteenth-century reform movement made similar arguments to those written here by Susan B. Anthony?Options: A. The temperance movement.  B. Utopian communities.  C. The abolition movement.  D. Public school advocates.
This question refers to the following information. Let us not, I beseech you sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.… It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! —Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775 The sentiments expressed by Patrick Henry led most directly to which of the following?Options: A. The Declaration of Independence  B. The Albany Plan  C. The Boston Tea Party  D. The Constitution of the United States
This question refers to the following information. "The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. . . . "It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government." —Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address, January 21, 1981 Which of the following ongoing debates in U.S. history is expressed in the quotation?Options: A. Debates over the powers of the president.  B. Debates over participation in elections.  C. Debates over federal power over the economy.  D. Debates over federal power over international affairs.
This question refers to the following information. "Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment….But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times." Thomas Jefferson, 1816 Which of the following best describes a contributing factor in the crafting of the United States Constitution?Options: A. Individual state constitutions written at the time of the Revolution tended to cede too much power to the federal government, leading to a call for reform on the part of Anti-Federalists.  B. The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation led James Madison to question their efficacy and prompted a formation of the Constitutional Congress in 1787  C. Difficulties over trade and foreign relations led to a repeal of overly restrictive tariffs required by the Articles of Confederation.  D. Washington's embarrassing failure at the Whiskey Rebellion led to Federalist demands for a new framework for federal power.
This question refers to the following information. "Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states. Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties…." Journals of the Continental Congress, 1777 A major weakness of the Articles of Confederation was that theyOptions: A. created a too-powerful chief executive  B. did not include a mechanism for their own amendment  C. made it too difficult for the government to raise money through taxes and duties  D. denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states
This question refers to the following information. "An act for the more effectual protection of the property of married women: "§1. The real property of any female who may hereafter marry, and which she shall own at the time of marriage, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, shall not be subject to the sole disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts, and shall continue her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female.

This question refers to the following information. "Whereas it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this kingdom, and for extending and securing the navigation and commerce between Great Britain and your Majesty's dominions in America, which, by the peace, have been so happily enlarged: and whereas it is just and necessary, that a revenue be raised, in your Majesty's said dominions in America, for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same; we, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of Great Britain, in parliament assembled, being desirous to make some provision, in this present session of parliament, towards raising the said revenue in America, have resolved to give and grant unto your Majesty the several rates and duties herein after-mentioned…."

This question refers to the following information. "The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely." —President Harry S. Truman, 1947 The passage above is part of President Truman's argument to Congress in favor ofOptions: A. the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (G.I. Bill).  B. development of the hydrogen bomb.  C. the McCarran Internal Security Act.  D. an extension of aid to Greece and Turkey.
This question refers to the following information. "We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from. "We found most people didn't even know the difference between communism and democracy. They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American." John Kerry, 1971 The two political issues that most concerned the Counterculture Movement of the 1960s wereOptions: A. U.S. involvement in Vietnam and flag burning  B. the civil rights movement and censorship  C. U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the civil rights movement  D. censorship and the draft
This question refers to the following information. "In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantage—the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places." Frederick Douglass, 1857 The excerpt from Frederick Douglass is most clearly an example of which of the following developments in the mid-nineteenth century?Options: A. The gradual replacement of indentured servants with African slaves  B. The preservation of African culture through cultural adaptation  C. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery  D. The success of abolitionists to sway majority public opinion
This question refers to the following information. Of all the band of adventurous cavaliers, whom Spain, in the sixteenth century, sent forth on the career of discovery and conquest, there was none more deeply filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise than Hernando Cortes. Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.… He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.… This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.… He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; … wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action! —William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843 The Spanish in America were interested in which of the following?Options: A. Escaping oppression at home  B. Expanding territories under Spanish control  C. Seeking religious freedom for themselves  D. Creating independent principalities for themselves
This question refers to the following information. "We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires. "Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity." Populist Party Platform, 1892 Which of the following is LEAST associated with the Populist movement?Options: A. Support of labor unions  B. Secret ballot elections  C. Free coinage of silver  D. Deregulation of railroads and utilities
This question refers to the following information. All this while the Indians came skulking about them, and would sometimes show themselves aloof off, but when any approached near them, they would run away; and once they stole away their tools where they had been at work and were gone to dinner. But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself. —William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation As the passage above makes clear, the Pilgrims were not the only Europeans in what would become Massachusetts during the 1620s. The area was already becoming important because of itsOptions: A. fishing.  B. farming.  C. mining.  D. shipbuilding.

This question refers to the following information. Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."… We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today. We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.… We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program. —Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934 Senator Huey P. Long's "Share the Wealth Society" was a political program intended toOptions: A. demonstrate Senator Long's commitment to fighting communism.  B. return the United States to the economic ideas of the late nineteenth century.  C. persuade voters that Senator Long had a plan to combat the Great Depression.  D. showcase Senator Long's understanding of the constitutional ideas of the Founding Fathers.
This question refers to the following information. "We are men; we have souls, we have passions, we have feelings, we have hopes, we have desires, like any other race in the world. The cry is raised all over the world today of Canada for the Canadians, of America for the Americans, of England for the English, of France for the French, of Germany for the Germans—do you think it is unreasonable that we, the Blacks of the world, should raise the cry of Africa for the Africans?" —Marcus Garvey, 1920 The passage could best be understood asOptions: A. an argument in favor of restrictions on immigration into the United States.  B. an attempt to unite working-class African American and white men and women.  C. an expression of black nationalism.  D. a pamphlet designed to promote the advancement of African Americans in industry.
This question refers to the following information. "I know that whenever the subject has occurred in conversation where I have been present, it has appeared to be the opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented. But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it." —Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766 President Jackson's policy was later altered by theOptions: A. Homestead Act of 1862.  B. Immigration Act of 1921.  C. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson.  D. Dawes Act of 1887.
This question refers to the following information. "The only force which is strong enough to break down social convention is economic necessity. . . . The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business." —The New York Times, October 15, 1905 Which of the following groups would have most likely supported the scenario described in this passage?Options: A. Ku Klux Klan.  B. American Temperance Union.  C. National Woman Suffrage Association.  D. Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
This question refers to the following information. Here is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has "the world before her." Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the "early and improvident marriage," against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. "I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day," said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence. —Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890 The situation faced by the young women in the passage above is most directly comparable to which of the following?Options: A. American revolutionaries in the 1770s  B. Slaves in the antebellum South  C. Populist farmers in the 1890s  D. Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s
This question refers to the following information. Let us not, I beseech you sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.… It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! —Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775 In this passage, Henry expresses an abiding American concern about which of the following?Options: A. No entangling alliances with foreign countries  B. The dangers of standing armies  C. Self-government  D. The separation of church and state

The debate between interventionism and isolationism in foreign policy.  B. The debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society.  C. The debate between exclusion and inclusion when it came to immigration policy.  D. The debate between laissez-faire policies and government intervention in economic affairs.
This question refers to the following information. "When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations that we thought would distribute Western influence throughout the world. Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people—these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency. "As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . ." —Port Huron Statement, 1962 The primary intended audience for the Port Huron Statement wasOptions: A. African Americans in the South.  B. government officials.  C. middle-class college students.  D. factory workers.
This question refers to the following information. "On the 4th of March next this party [the Republican party] will take possession of the government. It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States. The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the states will be lost. The slaveholding states will no longer have the power of self-government or self-protection, and the federal government will have become their enemy. "We, therefore, the people of South Carolina, by our delegates in convention assembled, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between this state and the other states of North America is dissolved; and that the state of South Carolina has resumed her position among the nations of the world, as [a] separate and independent state, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do." South Carolina defines the causes of secession, 1860 The sentiments above are most consistent with which of the following ideologies?Options: A. States' Rights  B. Nullification  C. Neutrality  D. Civil disobedience
This question refers to the following information. "The petition of several poor negroes and mulattoes, who are inhabitants of the town of Dartmouth, humbly showeth,— "That we being chiefly of the African extract, and by reason of long bondage and hard slavery, we have been deprived of enjoying the profits of our labor or the advantage of inheriting estates from our parents, as our neighbors the white people do, having some of us not long enjoyed our own freedom; yet of late, contrary to the invariable custom and practice of the country, we have been, and now are, taxed both in our polls and that small pittance of estate which, through much hard labor and industry, we have got together to sustain ourselves and families withall. We apprehend it, therefore, to be hard usage, and will doubtless (if continued) reduce us to a state of beggary, whereby we shall become a burthen to others, if not timely prevented by the interposition of your justice and your power. "Your petitioners further show, that we apprehend ourselves to be aggrieved, in that, while we are not allowed the privilege of freemen of the State, having no vote or influence in the election of those that tax us, yet many of our colour (as is well known) have cheerfully entered the field of battle in the defence of the common cause, and that (as we conceive) against a similar exertion of power (in regard to taxation), too well known to need a recital in this place." —Paul Cuffe's Petition, Massachusetts, 1780 The main purpose of the petition by Paul Cuffe, excerpted above, was to demandOptions: A. that the petitioners be released from slavery because slavery was incompatible with the Massachusetts constitution.

D. that the Massachusetts legislature either grant the petitioners the right to vote or that it excuse them from paying taxes.
This question refers to the following information. "The far-reaching, the boundless future will be the era of American greatness. In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High—the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere—its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood—of 'peace and good will amongst men.'" John L. O'Sullivan, "The Great Nation of Futurity," 1839 Which of the following presidents is most closely associated with the concept of Manifest Destiny?Options: A. James K. Polk  B. Andrew Johnson  C. Woodrow Wilson  D. Ronald Reagan
This question refers to the following information. I come not to urge personal claims, nor to seek individual benefits; I appear as the advocate of those who cannot plead their own cause; I come as the friend of those who are deserted, oppressed, and desolate. In the Providence of God, I am the voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses. I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures, hidden in your private dwellings, and in pens and cabins—shut out, cut off from all healing influences, from all mind-restoring cares.… Could their melancholy histories be spread before you as revealed to my grieved spirit during the last three months, how promptly, how earnestly would you search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling, how insignificant, by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to make; how would a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish in value as a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to be secured for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a sufficient fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.… —Dorothea Dix, Memorial Soliciting a State Hospital for the Protection and Cure of the Insane, Submitted to the General Assembly of North Carolina, November 1848 A key motivating factor for many reformers of the 1840s wasOptions: A.

This question refers to the following information. "I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters. I have read…the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground…" Roger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652 Which of the following documents encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?Options: A. The Mayflower Compact  B. The Fundamental Orders  C. The Halfway Covenant  D. The Cambridge Agreement
This question refers to the following information. "The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. . . . "It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government." —Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address, January 21, 1981 The conservative political revival that led to President Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 held the view thatOptions: A. political leaders in the 1960s and 1970s did not do enough to challenge the racial and economic status quo.

D. liberal laws and court decisions in the 1960s and a general moral decline were undermining the United States.
This question refers to the following information. "If any person or persons shall, from and after the passing of this act, by force and violence, take and carry away, or cause to be taken or carried away, and shall, by fraud or false pretense, seduce, or cause to be seduced, or shall attempt so to take, carry away or seduce, any negro or mulatto, from any part or parts of this commonwealth, to any other place or places whatsoever, out of this commonwealth, with a design and intention of selling and disposing of, or of causing to be sold, or of keeping and detaining, or of causing to be kept and detained, such negro or mulatto, as a slave or servant for life, or for any term whatsoever, every such person or persons, his or their aiders or abettors, shall on conviction thereof, in any court of this commonwealth having competent jurisdiction, be deemed guilty of a felony." —Excerpt from Pennsylvania law, 1826 Critics challenged the constitutionality of this 1826 law in the Supreme Court on the grounds that itOptions: A. violated the Constitutional injunction against bills of attainder.

This question refers to the following information. "Is there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature has so little to bind it to our country? The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance. Should its influence become concentrated, as it may under the operation of such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation. But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it cannot be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence." President Andrew Jackson, Veto of the Bank of the United States, 1832 Which of the following events most directly caused the formation of the Second Bank of the United States?Options: A. The failure of the Specie Circular  B. Unregulated currency and federal debts after the War of 1812  C. Efforts by Alexander Hamilton to stabilize the national economy  D.

This question refers to the following information. "The Opposition tells us that we ought not to govern a people without their consent. I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?…Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny." Albert J. Beveridge, "The March of the Flag," 1898 The United States became politically engaged with the Philippines after what military conflict?Options: A. Mexican-American War  B. World War II  C. Spanish-American War  D. The Boxer Rebellion
This question refers to the following information. "In the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation." Abigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams, 1776 "Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no means secure." Susan B. Anthony, "Declaration of Rights for Women," July 4, 1876 The sentiments expressed in the first excerpt by Abigail Adams best exemplify which of the following ideologies?Options: A. Second-wave feminism  B. Jeffersonian democracy  C. Republican motherhood  D. Libertarianism
This question refers to the following information. "With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state)." Election of 1864, Harpweek.com Which of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?Options: A. Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.  B. The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.  C. Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.  D. Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.
This question refers to the following information. "The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure. "This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place." Progressive Party Platform, 1912 Which of the following regulatory laws was passed as a result of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle?Options: A. The Clayton Antitrust act  B. The Hepburn Act  C. The Sherman Antitrust Act  D. The Pure Food and Drug Act
This question refers to the following information. "The far-reaching, the boundless future will be the era of American greatness. In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High—the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere—its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood—of 'peace and good will amongst men.'" John L. O'Sullivan, "The Great Nation of Futurity," 1839 Which of the following best describes the effect of the American rail system in the nineteenth century?Options: A. Government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient.  B. The entire national system was planned before the first railway was constructed.  C. The development of the rails had little effect on the development of American industry.  D. A more highly developed rail system gave the Confederacy a decided advantage in the Civil War.
This question refers to the following information. On Being Brought from Africa to America 'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land, Taught my benighted soul to understand That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too; Once I redemption neither sought nor knew. Some view our sable race with scornful eye, "Their colour is a diabolic die." Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain, May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train. —Phillis Wheatley, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, 1773 The sentiments expressed in Wheatley's poem most directly reflect which of the following continuities in U.S. history?Options: A. Debates over religious freedom  B. Debates over social justice  C. Debates over immigration  D. Debates over freedom of expression
This question refers to the following information. "Since the foundations of the American commonwealth were laid in colonial times over 300 years ago, vigorous complaint and more or less bitter persecution have been aimed at newcomers to our shores. Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The "Know-Nothings," lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day….But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers…..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst—a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War—Poland and Italy." Robert H. Clancy, Congressional Record, 68th Congress, 1st Session, 1924 The excerpt above is most likely a response toOptions: A. World War I patriotism  B. immigration quotas  C. labor strikes  D. the Red Scare
This question refers to the following information. Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to flounder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it—we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon, and the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.… We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. —John F. Kennedy, September 12, 1962 John F. Kennedy in this passage is urging his fellow Americans to emulate which of the following?Options: A. The pioneers  B. Progressive reformers  C.

This question refers to the following information. "When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations that we thought would distribute Western influence throughout the world. Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people—these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency. "As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . ." —Port Huron Statement, 1962 The Port Huron Statement, excerpted above, can most clearly be seen as an important document in which of the following movements?Options: A. The labor union movement.  B. The civil rights movement.  C. The New Right.  D. The New Left.
This question refers to the following information. The man who mounted the steps of the Capitol, March 4, 1801, to claim the place of an equal between Pitt and Bonaparte, possessed a character which showed itself in acts; but person and manner can be known only by contemporaries, and the liveliest description was worth less than a moment of personal contact. Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.… His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and "The Palace" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they "lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied." —Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889 As the great-grandson of President John Adams, the historian Henry Adams might have been expected to be which of the following?Options: A. Critical of the policies of Thomas Jefferson  B. Supportive of the policies of Thomas Jefferson  C. Critical of the Constitutional Convention  D. More interested in the French and Indian War
This question refers to the following information. "We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires. "Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity." Populist Party Platform, 1892 Which of the following was most directly a cause of the success of the Populist party?Options: A. Western farmers and ranchers favored conservation and organized to promote the National Parks system.  B. The growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to lobby for political reform.  C. Western farmers resisted the mechanization of agriculture and resented government interference in rural affairs.  D. After the Civil War, westward migration slowed, causing a long-term recession in many Western territories.
This question refers to the following information. They ask us how we shall govern these new possessions. I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day. Will you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did—we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward—we only continue the march of the flag? —Albert Beveridge, "The March of the Flag," Indianapolis, September 16, 1898 The policy advocated by Beveridge foreshadowed which of the following?Options: A. The rise of the United States to the status of a great power  B. A period of growing isolationism  C. A period of laissez-faire economics  D. Growing support for constitutional strict constructionism
This question refers to the following information. "If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion." —John C. Calhoun, "South Carolina Exposition and Protest," 1828 The issue that precipitated the passage excerpted above wasOptions: A. the removal of American Indians from the South.  B. the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.  C. the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates.  D. the funding of "internal improvements."

This question refers to the following information. "One-half of the people of this nation to-day are utterly powerless to blot from the statute books an unjust law, or to write there a new and a just one. The women, dissatisfied as they are with this form of government, that enforces taxation without representation,—that compels them to obey laws to which they have never given their consent,—that imprisons and hangs them without a trial by a jury of their peers, that robs them, in marriage, of the custody of their own persons, wages and children,—are this half of the people left wholly at the mercy of the other half, in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this government, every one of which was based on the immutable principle of equal rights to all." —Susan B. Anthony, "I Stand Before You Under Indictment" (speech), 1873 Which of the following was another common criticism of Andrew Carnegie?Options: A. As an immigrant, Carnegie had no right to own controlling interests in major American industries.  B.

Carnegie was seen as the epitome of American success, but he was not even the richest man in America.  D. Too much of Carnegie's philanthropic efforts were concentrated on his homeland of Scotland, denying Americans the benefits of his charity.

This question refers to the following information. "As a means of effecting this end I suggest for your consideration the propriety of setting apart an ample district west of the Mississippi, and without the limit of any State or Territory now formed, to be guaranteed to the Indian tribes as long as they shall occupy it. . . . There they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization. . . . "This emigration would be voluntary, for it would be as cruel and unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. . . ." —President Andrew Jackson, 1829 Based on this quotation, what can you infer about the efforts of Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement of the 1950s?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. Of all the band of adventurous cavaliers, whom Spain, in the sixteenth century, sent forth on the career of discovery and conquest, there was none more deeply filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise than Hernando Cortes. Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.… He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.… This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.… He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; … wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action! —William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843 As Prescott makes clear in the passage above, an important reason for Cortes's military success was which of the following?Options: A. The advantage of superior numbers  B. The superior military skill of mercenaries  C. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians  D. Effective use of European artillery
This question refers to the following information. "I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters. I have read…the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground…" Roger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652 Consistent with the excerpt above, Roger Williams was banished from Massachusetts Bay in 1636 for advocatingOptions: A. the separation of church and state  B. women's suffrage  C. bigamy  D. the export of tobacco
This question refers to the following information. "Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing…the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack….The attack yesterday…has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas….As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense." President Franklin D. Roosevelt, radio address, December 8, 1941 Which of the following was the most immediate consequence of the events described in the excerpt above?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. "The only force which is strong enough to break down social convention is economic necessity. . . . The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business." —The New York Times, October 15, 1905 The scenario described in the passage above is most directly reflected in the ideas of which of the following?Options: A. Civil Rights Act of 1964.  B. Equal Rights Amendment.  C. Pure Food and Drug Act.  D. Interstate Commerce Act.

Roman Catholics  B. Puritans  C. Quakers  D. Anglicans
This question refers to the following information. "On the 4th of March next this party [the Republican party] will take possession of the government. It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States. The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the states will be lost. The slaveholding states will no longer have the power of self-government or self-protection, and the federal government will have become their enemy. "We, therefore, the people of South Carolina, by our delegates in convention assembled, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between this state and the other states of North America is dissolved; and that the state of South Carolina has resumed her position among the nations of the world, as [a] separate and independent state, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do."

This question refers to the following information. "As a means of effecting this end I suggest for your consideration the propriety of setting apart an ample district west of the Mississippi, and without the limit of any State or Territory now formed, to be guaranteed to the Indian tribes as long as they shall occupy it. . . . There they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization. . . . "This emigration would be voluntary, for it would be as cruel and unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. . . ." —President Andrew Jackson, 1829 Which of the following Supreme Court decisions was the primary contributor to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King and others were trying to end?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. "The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely." —President Harry S. Truman, 1947 The ideas expressed in the passage above most directly reflect which of the following continuities in U.S. history?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. "I was once a tool of oppression And as green as a sucker could be And monopolies banded together To beat a poor hayseed like me.

B. a Republican leaflet in the 1870s.  C. a populist newspaper in the 1890s.  D. a civil rights pamphlet in the 1950s.
This question refers to the following information. Here is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has "the world before her." Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the "early and improvident marriage," against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. "I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day," said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence. —Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890 Riis's work as an investigator of the lives of the poor can most directly be associated with which of the following?Options: A. Yellow Journalism  B. Abolitionism  C. The muckrakers  D. Socialism
This question refers to the following information. No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our independence means little. The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we!

This question refers to the following information. Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities. —Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s How did the events depicted here affect Koreans?Options: A. They became a part of Japan’s territory.  B. The Americans established freedom for all Koreans.  C. The Korean economy never recovered.  D. Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.
This question refers to the following information. Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal . . . that things in general were settled for ever. —A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven. —The Prelude, by William Wordsworth Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives?Options: A. Optimistic, encouraged  B. Understanding, accepting  C. Cynical, enthusiastic  D. Sincere, resigned
This question refers to the following information. "The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa." Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974 Which of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?Options: A. Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.  B. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.  C. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.  D. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.
This question refers to the following information. Source 1: "It is impossible to demand that an impossible position should be cleared up by peaceful revision and at the same time constantly reject peaceful revision. It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles "Diktat" is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people. And then this document, with our signature, obtained by force, was proclaimed as a solemn law." Adolf Hitler, speech to the Reichstag, September 1, 1939 Source 2: "We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and the oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender." Winston Churchill, speech before Parliament, June 4, 1940 What is the historical background for Adolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1?Options: A. Hitler's belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated  B. A rising intolerance of ethnic and political minority groups  C. A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I  D. Hitler's attempted collaboration with Italian leader Benito Mussolini
This question refers to the following information. In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a "humanness"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals. Rudrangshu Mukherjee, "The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857," 1990 According to the second passage, the Cawnpore MassacreOptions: A. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.  B. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.  C. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.  D. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.
This question refers to the following information. "The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance." Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955 Which of the following best explains Mao's concept of the "socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture" in China?Options: A. Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers.  B. Agricultural surpluses allowed the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production.  C. Agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities, raising the standard of living across the whole of China.  D. Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.
This question refers to the following information. "The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country." Otto von Bismarck, 1884 The long-term effects of Otto von Bismarck's speech include which of the following?Options: A. Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe  B. Disunity of the German states  C. Communist overhaul of the eastern parts of Germany  D. A decrease in German economic output
This question refers to the following information. This ruler of Syria made me spend many years as commander of his army, Every land to which I turned I overcame. I destroyed its green fields and its wells, I captured its cattle, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived them of their provisions, and I slew [many] people…by my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices. Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor; …he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the success of my handiwork. There came a champion of Syria to defy me in my tent; a bold man without equal, for he had vanquished all his rivals. He said, "Let Sanehat fight with me." He thought to overcome me; he designed to take my cattle, thus being counseled by his tribe. The Tale of Sanehat, Egyptian poem written during the Middle Kingdom, ca.1800 B.C.E. The text of this passage is best seen as evidence of which of the following in Egyptian society?Options: A. Meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies  B. Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands  C. The clan as the basic political unit  D. A lack of emphasis on martial ability
This question refers to the following information. At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life. —Robert Guisepi, 1992 The Mongol empire used which of the following to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area?Options: A. Emphasis on trade networks  B. Expansion of bureaucracy to reinforce dominance  C. The use of state-sponsored religion to legitimize the government  D. Expansion of an interregional canal system
This question refers to the following information. This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs. French revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794 With which of the following threats does the speaker in the passage above seem most concerned?Options: A. Counterrevolutionary opponents  B. Foreign invaders  C. Communist agitators  D. Transnational corporations
This question refers to the following information. The invaders had brought in wheat and other Eurasian and African grains; peach, pear, orange, and lemon trees; chick-peas, grape vines, melons, onions, radishes, and much more. A Spanish nobleman come to America could require his Indians to furnish his table with the fruits of his ancestors. —Alfred Crosby, historian, 1972 What economic practice is referred to by the phrase "his Indians" in the quote?Options: A. Slavery  B. Indentured servitude  C. The encomienda system  D. The apprentice system

The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India  B. British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company  C. Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority  D. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government
This question refers to the following information. "Let a woman retire late to bed, but rise early to duties; let her nor dread tasks by day or by night. Let her not refuse to perform domestic duties whether easy or difficult. That which must be done, let her finish completely, tidily, and systematically, When a woman follows such rules as these, then she may be said to be industrious. Let a woman be correct in manner and upright in character in order to serve her husband. Let her live in purity and quietness of spirit, and attend to her own affairs. Let her love not gossip and silly laughter. Let her cleanse and purify and arrange in order the wine and the food for the offerings to the ancestors. When a woman observes such principles as these, then she may be said to continue ancestral worship. No woman who observes these three fundamentals of life has ever had a bad reputation or has fallen into disgrace. If a woman fail to observe them, how can her name be honored; how can she but bring disgrace upon herself?" © The East Asian Library and the Gest Collection, Princeton University.

This question refers to the following information. The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd. What is important about Sharpeville is not that seventy died: nor even that they were shot in the back retreating, unarmed, defenceless and certainty not the heavy caliber slug that tore through a mother's back and ripped through the child in her arms killing it Remember Sharpeville bullet-in-the-back day Because it epitomized oppression and the nature of society More clearly than anything else; it was the classic event Nowhere is racial dominance more clearly defined nowhere the will to oppress more clearly demonstrated What the world whispers apartheid declares with snarling guns the blood the rich lust after South Africa spills dust Remember Sharpeville Remember bullet-in-the-back day And remember the unquenchable will for freedom Remember the dead and be glad —Dennis Brutus, 1973 The discriminatory system referred to in the poem was known asOptions: A. Jim Crow.  B. spheres of influence.  C. Boer division.  D. apartheid.
This question refers to the following information. Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France.

This question refers to the following information. "The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal. Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope. Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope… …The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following." Martin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520 When the author of the passage above discusses the "second wall," to what is he referring?Options: A. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of "Holy Ghost"  B. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts  C. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus  D. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism
This question refers to the following information. "To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: "You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia." Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: "You are abundant," so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: "You are poor and impotent," so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you. That is why we must no longer lag behind." Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931 The speech as a whole is best understood in the context of which of the following historical developments?Options: A. Stalin's drive to motivate Soviet industry for the Winter War with Finland  B. Stalin's push to make the Soviet Union a nuclear nation  C. Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy  D. Stalin's purges of dissidents and other political prisoners

This question refers to the following information. The condition of foreign states is not what it once was; they have invented the steamship, and introduced radical changes in the art of navigation. They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire. —Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847 How did Japan respond to the concerns raised by Lord Ii during this era?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. New York! I say New York, let black blood flow into your blood. Let it wash the rust from your steel joints, like an oil of life Let it give your bridges the curve of hips and supple vines… See your rivers stirring with musk alligators And sea cows with mirage eyes… Just open your eyes to the April rainbow And your eyes, especially your ears, to God Who in one burst of saxophone laughter Created heaven and earth in six days, And on the seventh slept a deep Negro sleep.

This question refers to the following information. "From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you. Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors. Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven." Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E. The speech above is best understood in context of which of the following?Options: A. The Mongol invasions of the Middle East  B. The Protestant Reformation  C. The Age of Discovery  D. The Crusades
This question refers to the following information. "When the Portuguese go from Macao in China to Japan, they carry much white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain: and they bring from Japan nothing but silver. They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded. When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned." Ralph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.

This question refers to the following information. Is it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own progress and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour. Ghana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963 The speaker in the passage above is espousing which of the following causes?Options: A. Nationalism  B. Socialism  C. Pan-Africanism  D. Neocolonialism
This question refers to the following information. By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other. Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839 On which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?Options: A. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.  B. Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.  C.

This question refers to the following information. "The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal. Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope. Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope… …The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following." Martin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520 How is the "temporal power" mentioned in the passage best understood contextually?Options: A. A clerical or ecclesiastical authority  B. A legal or scholarly authority  C. A state or secular authority  D. A business or economic authority
This question refers to the following information. O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols… are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed. the Qur'an, Sura 5: 89 When once you hear the roses are in bloom, Then is the time, my love, to pour the wine. the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám A comparison of both verses would best support which of the following conclusions?Options: A.

Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations.  D. Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice.
This question refers to the following information. "The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country." Otto von Bismarck, 1884 How would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany?Options: A. Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.  B. Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances.  C. Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters.  D. Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities.
This question refers to the following information. "When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form. The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him. Of Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone—it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk." The Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E. *Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk. Which of the following best describes the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh?Options: A. The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems  B. The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art  C. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings  D. The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording

Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade  B. Competition between Dutch and Portuguese traders for markets in Japan  C. European participation in East Asian trade patterns  D. Jesuit missionary work in Japan and China
This question refers to the following information. "The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance." Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955 Mao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following?Options: A. Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest  B. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population  C. Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization  D. Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population
This question refers to the following information. "After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes." Germania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E. The views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?Options: A. Disgust for barbarian peoples  B. Concern about barbarian attacks  C. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy  D. Maintenance of large armies
This question refers to the following information. "The Chinese are all infidels: they worship images, and burn their dead just like the [Hindus]. The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan…In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China… When we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…" Ibn Battuta, Voyages, 1332–1346 C.E. Which of the following conclusions about the period 600 C.E.–1450 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?Options: A. Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated.  B. New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs.  C. The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia.  D. Technological developments spread across trade routes.
This question refers to the following information. Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out. Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors. Heinrich von Füch, "On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia," 1744 Both passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?Options: A. Emerging systems of coerced labor  B. The expansion of chattel slavery  C. Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces  D. Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies
This question refers to the following information. "At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck." Copyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press. Alfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004 Which of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the "quantum jump" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?Options: A. The colonization of the interior of Africa  B. The conquest of the Aztec Empire  C. The reformation of Catholic Christianity  D. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan
This question refers to the following information. Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition. William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, "On the Suppression of Sati," 1829 I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them]. George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826 The authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers?Options: A. Direct rule by the crown  B. Complete privatization of colonial authority  C. Martial law enforced by sizable armies  D. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits
This question refers to the following information. "Purusa-Sukta" Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation. It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep. When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites. —Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500–1000 BCE Which of the following statements is supported by the information in the passage above?Options: A. The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period.  B. The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability.  C. The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders.  D. The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.

This question refers to the following information. "The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers." Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961 The passage is most clearly an example of which of the following?Options: A. Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa  B. A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa  C. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world  D. Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa

This question refers to the following information. The passage below is taken from testimony before Parliament. Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined. You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages? —I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.

Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men?

This question refers to the following information. But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians. —Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon The author of the above passage claims: "Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest." What does he mean by this?Options: A. The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.  B. The empire became too large to control effectively.  C. Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.  D. Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.

This question refers to the following information. I don't know whether this world has meaning that transcends it.

This question refers to the following information. "Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails." Nicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E. The political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?Options: A. It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority.  B. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.  C. It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past.  D. It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries.

This question refers to the following information. "We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards. Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny…We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty." Simón de Bolívar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819 Simón de Bolívar, the author of the passage, accomplished which of the following?Options: A. The first union of independent Latin American states  B. The first military victory of the War of 1812  C. The first military victory of the Spanish-American War  D. The first political coup by someone of mixed-race descent

This question refers to the following information. "When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form. The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him. Of Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone—it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk."

This question refers to the following information. "After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes."

This question refers to the following information. "The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year…. And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden. And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute. There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians."

This question refers to the following information. Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward. —Robert K.

This question refers to the following information. The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani . —The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer What is the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury?Options: A.

This question refers to the following information. In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a "humanness"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals. Rudrangshu Mukherjee, "The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857," 1990 From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at CawnporeOptions: A. seems to mark a betrayal of a "higher" race by a "lesser" race.  B. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.  C. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.  D. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.

This question refers to the following information. Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan. The Slave Trade All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for "black Africans"]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices: A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries. They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping. An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful. A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody. How was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade?Options: A. Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion.  B. Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did.  C. Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male.  D. Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade.
This question refers to the following information. Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out. Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors. Heinrich von Füch, "On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia," 1744 Which of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?Options: A. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan  B. The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers  C. The general warming of the climate during this time period  D. The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites
This question refers to the following information. Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

Heinrich von Füch, "On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia," 1744 The system of labor described in the first passage came into being in which of the following ways?Options: A. Spanish colonists enslaved native American populations outright.  B. Spain refused to purchase slaves from Africa, relying instead on native American labor.  C. Spanish authorities adapted local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes.  D. Spanish landowners came to depend heavily on plantation monoculture.
This question refers to the following information. At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life. —Robert Guisepi, 1992 The legacies or adaptations of legacies from the Mongol empire are varied. Most notably, they include which of the following selections?Options: A. Public libraries  B. Universal health care  C. The game of chess  D. Religious tolerance
This question refers to the following information. Know the self to be sitting in the chariot, the body to be the chariot, the intellect the charioteer, and the mind the reins. He who has understanding, who is mindful and always pure, indeed reaches that place from whence he is not born again. from the Upanishads, India, circa 600s–400s B.C.E. Which of the following changes to Indian religious practice took place under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka?Options: A. The rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith  B. The arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders  C. The eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force  D. The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts
This question refers to the following information. "In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion." W.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920 Moreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations?Options: A. Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.  B. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.  C. Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.  D. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.
This question refers to the following information. By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other. Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839 The passage is most closely related with which of the following broad developments?Options: A. Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens  B. Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China  C. Europe's economic domination of China  D. Europe's colonization of Chinese territory
This question refers to the following information. "Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. "There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them." From N. Levtzion & J.F.P. Hopkins, eds. Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History. Cambridge University Press, 1981. Reprinted with permission of Cambridge University Press. Al' Umari, ca. 1300–1384 Which of the following inferences is most supported by the discussion of copper and gold in the passage?Options: A. Mali was able to forge advanced bronze tools from its mineral resources.  B. International trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources.  C. The jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit.  D. Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth.
This question refers to the following information. Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition. William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, "On the Suppression of Sati," 1829 I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them]. George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826 Which of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives?Options: A. Ivory  B. Tobacco  C. Silver  D. Furs
This question refers to the following information. The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd. What is important about Sharpeville is not that seventy died: nor even that they were shot in the back retreating, unarmed, defenceless and certainty not the heavy caliber slug that tore through a mother's back and ripped through the child in her arms killing it Remember Sharpeville bullet-in-the-back day Because it epitomized oppression and the nature of society More clearly than anything else; it was the classic event Nowhere is racial dominance more clearly defined nowhere the will to oppress more clearly demonstrated What the world whispers apartheid declares with snarling guns the blood the rich lust after South Africa spills dust Remember Sharpeville Remember bullet-in-the-back day And remember the unquenchable will for freedom Remember the dead and be glad —Dennis Brutus, 1973 What event symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination?Options: A. The election of F. W. de Klerk  B. The election of Nelson Mandela  C. The bombing of Lesotho  D. The Boer War
This question refers to the following information. Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King! What's this that you have done? Is 't not a very naughty thing To snatch the kaiser's crown? Now you will have to stay away Alike from Rhine and Prague, And more than that-shame and dismay Your days and nights will plague. Right well you knew, and all the world, Right well they know this thing, That Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king. So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go To Ferdinand, your king, And beg him graciously to show Full pardon for your sin. "Poor Winter King," seventeenth-century song Based on the song, the Winter King did which of the following?Options: A. Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand  B. Successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire  C. Rebelled against King Ferdinand  D. Claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church
This question refers to the following information. "MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE. REMAIN NON-VIOLENT The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:— Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown. The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest. He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme. I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute. By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights. Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal." Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921 Which of the following historical developments from the period 1450–1750 C.E. most inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth?Options: A. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires  B. The development of joint-stock companies  C. The importation of food crops from the New World  D. The African slave trade
This question refers to the following information. Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal . . . that things in general were settled for ever. —A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven. —The Prelude, by William Wordsworth Most revolutions produce a strong leading figure; the French Revolution allowed which of the following to assume great power?Options: A. King Louis XVI  B. Robespierre  C. Jean Lafitte  D. Lafayette
This question refers to the following information. The passage below is taken from testimony before Parliament. Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined. You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages? —I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly. When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence? —No, it will not keep it as it should do. Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked? —Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work. Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity? —No. —Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831–32 Which period in history is associated with the conditions described in the passage?Options: A. The Enlightenment  B. The Green Revolution  C. The Scientific Revolution  D. The Industrial Revolution
This question refers to the following information. I don't know whether this world has meaning that transcends it. But I know that I do not know that meaning, and that it is impossible just now for me to know it. What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me? I can understand only in human terms. Albert Camus, "The Myth of Sisyphus," 1955 The passage above is best seen as exemplifying which of the following intellectual trends?Options: A. A postwar reassertion of traditional religious values  B. An expression of patriotic pride thanks to victory in World War II  C. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities  D. An increased willingness to embrace radical Marxism
This question refers to the following information. That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know. … He looked to the West and prayed, "I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal." When he had prayed he bowed again. From Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s Accounts of Xuanzang's travels from both the 600s and 1500s C.E. are inspired by which of the following accomplishments?Options: A. Xuanzang's career as a spy against the Gupta Empire  B. Xuanzang's conversion of South Asian Hindus  C. Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India  D. Xuanzang's opening of new trade routes to Southeast Asia
This question refers to the following information. Source 1: "The case of a broken thigh is analogous to that of the arm, but in particular, a fractured thigh is mostly deranged forwards and outwards, for the bone is naturally flattened on those sides. It is to be set by the hands, with ligatures, and even cords applied, the one above and the other below the fracture. When the fracture takes place at one end, if at the head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perineum, and the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture." Paul of Aegina, Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose, late seventh century C.E. Source 2: "Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials." Ibn Sina (Avicenna), On Medicine, ca. 1020 C.E. The two passages on medicine illustrate which of the following cultural exchanges that occurred in the period 600–1450 C.E.?Options: A. The influence of Mesoamerican science on Europeans through systems of trade and navigation  B. The influence of Chinese science on Islamic civilizations through European immigration to Islamic lands  C. The influence of Egyptian science on the Byzantines through European scholars  D. The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars
This question refers to the following information. New York! I say New York, let black blood flow into your blood. Let it wash the rust from your steel joints, like an oil of life Let it give your bridges the curve of hips and supple vines… See your rivers stirring with musk alligators And sea cows with mirage eyes… Just open your eyes to the April rainbow And your eyes, especially your ears, to God Who in one burst of saxophone laughter Created heaven and earth in six days, And on the seventh slept a deep Negro sleep. Senegalese poet Léopold Sédar Senghor, "To New York," 1956 The verse above is best seen as belonging to which of the following modern cultural developments?Options: A. The triumph of avant-garde literary styles over traditional realism  B. The adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors  C. The political use of art and literature for propagandistic purposes  D. The response of interwar literary figures to the horrors of World War I

This question refers to the following information. Source 1: "We proclaim Him also by our senses on all sides, and we sanctify the noblest sense, which is that of sight. The image is a memorial, just what words are to a listening ear. What a book is to the literate, that an image is to the illiterate. The image speaks to the sight as words to the ear; it brings us understanding." John of Damascus, Apologia Against Those Who Decry Holy Images, ca. 730 C.E. Source 2: "To make our confession short, we keep unchanged all the ecclesiastical traditions handed down to us, whether in writing or verbally, one of which is the making of pictorial representations, agreeable to the history of the preaching of the Gospel, a tradition useful in many respects, but especially in this, that so the incarnation of the Word of God is shown forth as real and not merely fantastic, for these have mutual indications and without doubt have also mutual significations." Decree of the Second Council of Nicaea, 787 C.E. Which of the following religious movements was ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages?Options: A. Sunni Islam  B. Buddhism  C. Zoroastrianism  D. Jainism
This question refers to the following information. "Thereupon it was declared by the above-mentioned representatives of the aforesaid King and Queen of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, etc., and of the aforesaid King of Portugal and the Algarves, etc.: [I.] That, whereas a certain controversy exists between the said lords, their constituents, as to what lands, of all those discovered in the ocean sea up to the present day, the date of this treaty, pertain to each one of the said parts respectively; therefore, for the sake of peace and concord, and for the preservation of the relationship and love of the said King of Portugal for the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., it being the pleasure of their Highnesses, they, their said representatives, acting in their name and by virtue of their powers herein described, covenanted and agreed that a boundary or straight line be determined and drawn north and south, from pole to pole, on the said ocean sea, from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole. This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors.

This question refers to the following information. "The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa." Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974 Based on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.?Options: A. The invention of the machine gun  B. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases  C. The development of the joint-stock company  D. The invention of steam-powered ships
This question refers to the following information. "Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace." Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E. Which of the following correctly describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage?Options: A. The geography of Greece contains many natural resources that facilitated a profitable mining industry.  B. The geography of Greece contains numerous freshwater lakes that facilitated a successful fishing industry.  C. The geography of Greece contains prominent river valleys that facilitated widespread agriculture.  D. The geography of Greece contains many natural harbors that facilitated trade and commerce.
This question refers to the following information. "Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails." Nicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E. Machiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of which of the following?Options: A. A time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society  B. A time of increasing religious devotion among the elite Italian scholars  C. A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions  D. A time of collegial cooperation between scholars and ecclesiastical authorities in Italy
This question refers to the following information. The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793). Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity. How did the Chinese restrict foreign trade during the era 1750–1900?Options: A. European merchants were confined to a few cities designated for foreign trade.  B. Only the Dutch traded with China; other Europeans had to use them as intermediaries.  C. The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products.  D. They passed laws intended to persecute and harass foreign residents.
This question refers to the following information. Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves! Olympe de Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen," 1791 The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed. Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence Based on both passages, which of the following conclusions can be most reasonably made about revolutions?Options: A. The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed.  B. The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities.  C. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.  D. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.
This question refers to the following information. "At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck." Copyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.

This question refers to the following information. Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition. William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, "On the Suppression of Sati," 1829 I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them]. George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826 The passages above are best understood in the context of which of the following practices?Options: A. Legalization of slavery in overseas colonies  B. Exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples  C. Western missionary efforts in colonized territories  D.

This question refers to the following information. "The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries.

Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program.

Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.  D. Yes, because the city's action would deprive the owners of all economic use of their property.

Yes, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law.  B. Yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted.  C. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.  D. No, because she entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger, and she assumed the risk.
A teenage girl was babysitting a two-year-old baby. She took the baby in a stroller to the public park, as she often did. On this day, she negligently "nodded off" for just a few seconds on a park bench with the stroller next to her. She felt some movement and snapped awake to see a man taking the baby from the stroller. The man was large and menacing-looking. The babysitter, who is thin and petite, froze and did not put up a struggle as the man stated, "I will kill you if you move." The babysitter did scream and call for help as the kidnapper fled with the child. Within a few yards he tripped and dropped the baby on its head. The baby died at the hospital of massive head injuries. Is it probable that the prosecutor will charge the babysitter with a crime, and if so, what will be the charge?Options: A. Yes, this is felony murder in that the babysitter's unacceptable behavior was committed during the commission of the kidnapping felony.  B. No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances  her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.  C. No, because she did not do anything wrong in dozing off and she had no duty to protect the baby at the expense of her own life.  D. Yes, she would be charged with negligent homicide because it was foreseeable that if she fell asleep for even just a few seconds, the baby would likely be kidnapped and killed.

Congress passed a federal statute that prohibited all "indecent" and "patently offensive" broadcasts on the Internet. The purpose of the statute was to protect children from accessing pornographic materials. The law imposed a blanket prohibition on any communications that could be accessed by children and which might contain the feared material. A group of Internet publishers filed an action to have the law declared unconstitutional and unenforceable. They proved that many instances of artistic expression and non-prurient broadcasts could fall within the wide parameters of the law. The government argued that its interest in protecting children outweighed the other considerations, and that millions of parents who are now afraid to access the Internet would use the service because the new law made it safe for children. What will the Supreme Court decide?Options: A. The law violates the First Amendment because it does not precisely regulate the content of speech and can be broadly applied to eliminate free speech for adults.  B. The law is a precise and narrow proscription that applies only to pornographic materials and its wording will be approved because it is necessary to protect children.  C. The law is constitutional because it is a reasonable exercise of the police power of the federal government.  D. The law is unconstitutional because it invades the absolute right to privacy that adults expect to be protected when using the Internet.

A 12-year-old boy decided to play a practical joke. Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed.

The owner of a meatpacking company was charged under a state criminal code prohibiting the sale of contaminated meat. The state's highest court has construed the code as imposing strict and vicarious liability to the extent allowed by the federal Constitution. The evidence at trial established that the owner's company had sold contaminated meat that had sickened hundreds of consumers. It further showed, however, that the owner had been out of the country when the meat was sold and had had no reason to know that any of the meat was contaminated.

A criminal defendant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to ten years in prison, starting on Jan. 1, 2000. Sec. 204 of the state penal code provided for early release for good behavior, and under that provision he would have been granted supervised release as of Jan. 1, 2007. On Feb. 1, 2006, the state legislature repealed Sec. 204 and passed Sec. 205a. It reduced the good time credits for anyone convicted from that date onward, and also for anyone in prison as of the date of the section's passage. The new release date was calculated to be Jan. 1, 2009. The criminal defendant brought a habeas corpus action arguing that Sec. 205a was an unenforceable ex post facto law as to him. The state courts turned him down saying that good time credit was a privilege and not a vested right. The case ultimately came before the U.S. Supreme Court. Did the Supreme Court invalidate Sec. 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law?Options: A. No, because good time credits were an act of grace that could be taken away at any time.  B. Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.  C. Yes, because the legislature does not have the authority to pass a law that decreases good time credits for prisoners.  D. No, the criminal defendant did not have a vested right in the early release date.
The owner of a drug store hired an independent contractor to renovate the store. Among other things, the renovations included installing a new front door made of plate glass. The contractor purchased the door from a glass door company. The sales representative of the glass door company told the contractor and the owner that plate glass was "super safe" and could withstand considerable pressure. The contractor installed the door, completed the other renovation work, and the store reopened for business later that same month. A few weeks later, a shopper and her 9-year- old son went to the drug store to purchase some merchandise. As they approached the store, the son was skipping ahead of his mother. Until he was within a few steps of the door, he thought it was open. When he realized it was, in fact, closed, he slowed down and, while still "going faster than walking," pushed his hand against the handle to push open the door. His hand slipped off the handle and, at the same time, there was a "kind of exploding noise. " Due to a defect, the glass shattered and broke, cutting the son's hand and wrist. A subsequent inspection revealed that the glass door had been negligently installed by the contractor. If the shopper, on behalf of her son, asserts a claim against the glass door company based on strict products liability, the plaintiff willOptions: A. prevail, because the glass door was defective.  B. prevail, because the sales representative represented the plate glass as being "super safe. "  C. not prevail, because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door.  D. not prevail, because the son negligently pushed open the glass door.
A developer built a mini-mall in the city. In order to finance the construction of the mall, the developer obtained a $500,000 commercial loan from a bank. The loan was secured by a mortgage that contained an after-acquired property clause that provided:"(The developer) hereby covenants that the terms of this mortgage shall apply to all after-acquired property which said mortgagor shall hereafter acquire; andMortgagee-bank's security interest in such after- acquired property shall take priority over all other parties claiming an interest in such property. "The bank duly recorded this mortgage on August 15, 2007. On September 6, 2008, the developer purchased a four-story office building in a nearby city. The building was in need of much renovation. To finance the improvements, the developer borrowed $250,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the developer executed a promissory note for $250,000, payable to the friend in 10 years and secured by a mortgage on the office building. This mortgage was dated September 9, 2008 and recorded the following day. During the early part of 2009, the developer experienced serious financial setbacks and failed to make the monthly mortgage payments to the bank and the friend. After the developer went into default on both loans, the bank instituted a foreclosure action on both the mini-mall and the office building. The friend intervened, claiming that his security interest in the office building took priority over the after-acquired rights claimed by the bank. This jurisdiction maintains a grantor grantee index and has the following recording statute in effect:"An unrecorded mortgage, deed, or other instrument is invalid as against a subsequent mortgagee or bona fide purchaser for value without notice. "In determining which security interest in the office building should be given priority, the court should hold in favor ofOptions: A. the bank, because its mortgage was recorded prior in time.  B. the bank, because the after-acquired property clause in its mortgage is enforceable and takes priority over the friend's subsequent security interest.  C. the friend, because the bank's prior recorded mortgage is outside the friend's chain of title.  D. the friend, because an after-acquired property clause is void against public policy and cannot encumber real estate subsequently acquired by the mortgagor.
Collection of a debtor's $2,000 debt to a creditor was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The debtor sold and delivered his car to a buyer under a written agreement, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer promised to pay the $2,000 purchase price to the creditor "in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor]." Can the creditor recover the $2,000 from the buyer?Options: A. No, because payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.  B. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.  C. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.  D. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt.
In 1998, a landowner owned a 30-acre tract located just inside the city. The tract included the family home, a decaying antebellum mansion complete with tennis courts, stables and a smaller second house that was once occupied by tenants who farmed the city. The second house, however, had long been vacant as a result of the economic decay of the surrounding area.

A city housing code limits the occupancy of all dwelling units in the city to members of a single family. The chief purpose of the code is to limit traffic congestion and noise in the neighborhood. One provision in the code provides that a "family" means a number of individuals related to the nominal head of the household or to the latter's spouse living as a single housekeeping unit in a single dwelling unit, but is limited to the following:(a) husband or wife of the nominal head of the household;(b) married or unmarried children of the nominal head of the household or the latter's spouse, provided, however, that such married or unmarried children have no children of their own residing with them;(c) father or mother of the nominal head of the household or of the latter's spouse. A resident of the city lives in her home together with her son and his two children. She received a notice of violation from the city which stated that both grandchildren were illegal occupants of her home and that she must comply with the code. After she fails to remove her two grandchildren, the city brings criminal charges against the resident. In an action by the resident challenging the constitutionality of the code provision, the court will most likely declare the provisionOptions: A. constitutional, on the grounds that the housing provision bears a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.  B. constitutional, under the state police power.  C. unconstitutional, as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  D. unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.
A bank teller was on trial for embezzlement. The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?Options: A. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.  B. Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.  C. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.  D. Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.
The civic auditorium is owned by the city. The auditorium is rented out to various organizations throughout the year. With a seating capacity of 1,500, it is customarily leased for rock concerts, rodeos, sporting events, fashion shows, etc. In January, a rock star held a week-long concert there, drawing a full house each night. Generally, the city leases the auditorium's facilities for a charge of $2,000 per day. In February, a religious sect applied to rent the auditorium for its annual celebration. However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a "closed door" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?Options: A. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.  B. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.  C. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.  D. Yes, because a city ordinance is not a state action, per Se, and, therefore, is not subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.
During his lunch break one day, an employee took a company vehicle to a fast-food restaurant and got into an accident on the way back. The driver of the other car sued the company.

The boss offers to testify that the employee called him five minutes after the accident and stated, "I hope you won't be sore, because I took the company car without permission. "The court should rule that this evidence isOptions: A. admissible as a declaration against interest.  B. admissible as an admission.  C. inadmissible, because the employee was not unavailable.  D. inadmissible, because it violates the employee's Fifth Amendment rights.
A driver parked his automobile in front of a row of shops, one of which was a barber shop where he planned to get a haircut. Realizing that he did not have any change for the parking meter, the driver entered the closest shop, a convenience store, to get change for a $10 bill. After the driver obtained change from one of the clerks in the convenience store, a section of the store's ceiling fell on him as he was about to leave the store. The store had failed to discover the weakened condition of the ceiling. The driver suffered serious head injuries from the falling plaster. In an action by the driver against the convenience store for negligence, the plaintiff will most likelyOptions: A. recover, because the store was negligent in failing to inspect its premises and discover dangerous conditions that might harm its invitees.  B. recover, because the driver had intended to purchase merchandise when he entered the store.  C. not recover, because the driver was merely a licensee in the store.  D. not recover, because the store only had an obligation to disclose to invitees any known dangerous conditions on the premises.
A retiree, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding "upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns," stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would beOptions: A. that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.  B. that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.  C. that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.  D. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.
In an effort to counteract a steep increase in juvenile crime, a state enacted a law terminating the parental rights of any state resident whose child under 16 years of age is convicted of a violent crime in the state. The law directs the state juvenile court to enter a termination order in such a case after the parent has been afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing at which the only relevant issues are the age of the child and whether the child has been convicted of a violent crime in the state. Is the state law constitutional?Options: A. No, because the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial state interest.  B. No, because the law is not necessary to serve a compelling state interest.  C. Yes, because a state's police power authorizes it to punish criminal behavior with appropriate sanctions.  D. Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
At a defendant's trial for the murder of his former employer, the prosecutor offers into evidence a note that was found during a lawful search of the defendant's apartment.

" At trial, the defendant's former girlfriend is called by the prosecution to testify that the handwriting was, in fact, the defendant's. The defendant's attorney objects. The trial judge shouldOptions: A. sustain the objection on the grounds that the former girlfriend's testimony would be inadmissible opinion evidence.  B. sustain the objection on the grounds that identification of handwriting requires expert testimony.  C. overrule the objection on the grounds that the former girlfriend qualifies as an authenticating witness.  D. overrule the objection on the grounds that the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.
A victim was killed by a gunshot in the presence of three men. The fatal wound was inflicted by a single shot, and there was no suggestion of a conspiracy among those present. One of the three men was charged with the killing. The prosecution called one of the other men as its first witness. His testimony, if true, established that the defendant fired the shot that killed the victim. The defendant's attorney then called the man's longtime neighbor to impeach him.

Federal law prohibits "willingly and knowingly" taking cash in excess of $10,000 from the U.S. into a foreign country without first reporting the transaction in detail. An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of "willingly and knowingly" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?Options: A. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.  B. Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.  C. No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.  D. No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.

She testified that she could not remember the specific times, but that she maintained a diary in which she had accurately recorded this information on a daily basis. When her attorney sought to refresh her recollection with her diary, she still could not remember. The plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the information in the diary admitted at trial. Is the information admissible?Options: A. No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.  B. No, unless it is offered by the defendant.  C. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.  D. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.

A 35-year-old man with some experience as a truck driver owned a lumber truck. One day, the man set out driving his truck, heavily loaded with lumber, down a mountain road. Sitting next to the man in the passenger seat was a 19-year-old helper. During the course of the trip, when the truck was going down a long hill, the brakes failed. The man shouted to the helper to jump, but the teenager refused to do so and shouted back to the man that he should try to steer the truck down the hill. The man then opened the door on the passenger's side of the truck and negligently pushed the helper out. The helper, who suffered a broken leg, was rushed to the hospital where he was treated for his injury. As the helper was recuperating, a nurse inadvertently mixed up his chart with that of the female patient in the next room. The nurse gave the helper a fertility pill that made him sterile.

He searched the car anyway and found two cartons of freshly canned peaches, which were owned by the driver's neighbor and reported stolen off of her porch 24 hours earlier. Authorities charged him with theft under the state criminal code. His motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search was denied. On appeal, will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court decision denying the motion to suppress?Options: A. Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.  B. Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making any search.  C. No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.  D. No, because driver being fidgety is enough for a probable cause full search of the vehicle.
An owner of a large, three-story office building planned to renovate the building and requested several contractors to submit bids to perform the work. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, "I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. "Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs.

B. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.  C. $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.  D. $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.
An architect agreed with a developer to design a large residential development. Because the architect had a history of substance abuse problems, the parties agreed that the developer's duty to accept and pay for the plans was conditioned on the architect's abstaining from drinking alcohol during the six months it would take to do the work. After two months, the architect began having several alcoholic drinks each day. The developer became aware of the architect's drinking before the architect showed the developer the preliminary plans. When the developer saw the preliminary plans, the developer told the architect that the concept was impressive and that he looked forward to seeing the final plans. The architect continued to have several alcoholic drinks each day and completed the plans within the specified contract period. However, the developer declined to review, accept, or pay for the final plans and stated that it was because of the architect's continued use of alcohol. The architect has sued the developer for breach of contract. Which of the following arguments best supports the architect's claim?Options: A. The alcohol use was not a material breach of contract by the architect, since it did not affect the quality of the work.  B. The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.  C. The no-alcohol term was functionally a penalty clause and therefore was unenforceable.  D. The no-alcohol term would be interpreted as a promise and not a condition.

The Native American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Native Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own "Native American Power" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party.

The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.
The state registrar of elections refused to put a candidate's name on the ballot because the registrar believed that the candidate was not a resident of the state. The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives "be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. " As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?Options: A. There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.  B. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.  C. The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.  D. Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.

The defendant was arrested and charged with murdering the victim. At trial, the witness proposes to testify to the victim's statement. Upon objection by defendant's counsel, the court should rule the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statementOptions: A. admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.  B. admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.  C. inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  D. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
On Friday night, a driver was injured in an automobile accident after his vehicle was sideswiped by an unidentified motorist. Following the accident, the driver was admitted to the hospital where he was treated for his injuries. While at the hospital, the driver was diagnosed with a broken back. He was put in a body cast and then placed in traction. The driver's physician assembled the traction apparatus and positioned the driver's left leg in an overhead stirrup at a 40-degree angle. The driver was instructed to lie on his back on the bed. On Saturday morning after breakfast, the driver requested a bedpan from a nurse. She was placing the bedpan under the driver's body when the stirrup, which was holding his leg, broke. This caused the driver's leg to fall against the metal framing along the side of the bed, fracturing his tibia. The traction apparatus was defective because the manufacturer had not included a safety latch on the stirrup device to prevent its falling off if not securely fastened in place. If the driver asserts a claim against the manufacturer, he will most likelyOptions: A. prevail, because the stirrup broke while the traction apparatus was in normal use.  B. prevail, because the manufacturer's failure to include a safety latch made the traction apparatus defective.  C. not prevail, because the traction apparatus was no longer within the control of the manufacturer.  D. not prevail, if the physician did not properly attach the stirrup when assembling the traction apparatus.
A criminal defendant went to trial and was convicted. After exhausting his appeals, he filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. He established that his counsel had not advised him of the benefits of plea bargaining, and had withheld several offers for guilty pleas from the government. The offers expired for lack of a response. The sentence he received was at least seven to eight years more than if he had entered a guilty plea. Will the court likely decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel?Options: A. Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.  B. No, because plea bargaining is not a critical necessity in a criminal case and counsel has no duty to discuss such options with the defendant.  C. When the defendant indicates he wants to fight the charges, there is no need for counsel to relay plea offers or discuss the options with him.  D. Because this defendant was convicted at a fair trial he didn't lose any rights and was not prejudiced by his lawyer's mistakes.
A husband visits an attorney seeking a divorce because of his wife's infidelity. At the client consultation, the attorney's secretary took notes. With the permission bf the husband, the attorney's law clerk also sat in on the consultation to see how the attorney conducted these meetings. Shortly after this initial consultation with the attorney, the secretary quit. During the divorce trial, the wife's attorney seeks to call the secretary to testify about what the husband told the attorney during the initial client consultation. Upon objection, the secretary's proposed testimony will most likely beOptions: A. admissible, because her presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney-client privilege.  B. admissible, because the law clerk's presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney- client privilege.  C. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege disqualifies the secretary from testifying to such confidential communications.  D. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
In an effort to improve the health care of cancer patients, a state's legislature has enacted a law providing public funds to assist privately owned hospitals. According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each cancer patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy "would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. "Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute?Options: A. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary power over the allocation of their public funds.  B. Public subsidies in hospitals are privileges rather than rights and, therefore, are not entitlements protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  C. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.  D. The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.
Section 2022(a) of a state's medical licensing code provides:"For the purposes of this statute, only those persons who have graduated from an optometry school located in the state and accredited by the board of optometrists shall be licensed to conduct the practice of optometry within the state. "A doctor graduated from a school of optometry located in a neighboring state. The following month, the doctor was granted a license to practice optometry in that neighboring state by its board of optometrists. For approximately one year, the doctor was engaged in the practice of optometry in the neighboring state. Subsequently, the doctor decided to relocate his practice to the state for which Section 2022(a) applies. The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice. If the doctor challenges the constitutionality of Section 2022(a) of the medical licensing statute as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following, if factually true, is the WEAKEST defense that the state could offer?Options: A. The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.  B. The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.  C. The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.  D. The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.

A man was prosecuted for the alleged murder of his estranged wife. At trial, the government was allowed to present the testimony of several women who testified to having flirtatious or sexual encounters with the defendant over the past 20 years prior to the homicide. None of the testimony showed any such activity within three years of the murder date, and none of it showed any violent tendencies of the defendant or intentions expressed that he wanted to kill his wife.

C. No, if the testimony was admitted in error it was harmless error that did not sway the jury one way or another and so the defendant got a fair trial in all other respects.  D. No, the testimony was admissible because it tended to show a pattern of "transferred intent" that proved the defendant's great hostility to his wife, and his need to eliminate her from his life so that he could go back to having a wild life.

A man died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter "to share and share alike as tenants in common. "At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?Options: A. The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.  B. The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.  C. The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.  D. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.

A large man with menacing tattoos all over his face and bald head followed closely behind a businessman who was lost in a long dark alley. The large man followed the businessman for several blocks of unending, unlit alleys. The businessman was in great fear. The large man was just a few feet behind, singing songs about how he was going to have a "big meal tonight" and it looked like he "had struck it rich," and other words indicating possible violence and robbery. Finally, the businessman threw his wallet in one direction and ran the other way, as he yelled, "You can have my money, just leave me my life!" The large man picked up the wallet and ran in the opposite direction, but when he came to the end of the alley he was arrested and charged with robbery. He appealed his conviction, arguing that he had no intent to steal and was trying to return the wallet to the victim. Will the appellate court likely affirm the robbery conviction?Options: A. No, the large man's songs could have been coincidental or unthinking, he made no threats, and later could have been trying to return the wallet.  B.

A landlord owns a two-story building. The landlord leased the building and the surrounding property to a tenant for a term commencing on December 1, 2006 and terminating on November 30, 2008. Their leasehold agreement contained the following provisions: "The tenant covenants to pay the rent of $500 per month on the first day of each month and to keep the building situated upon leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. "On April 15, 2007, the tenant had her annual "Tax Time Party" where she and her friends would all walk to the post office together to mail their taxes and then have drinks and dinner at the tenant's apartment to celebrate.

A man attended a convention at a hotel, but did not get a room. One evening armed security officers detained him and accused him of stealing. According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him "wandering aimlessly", and at times "suspiciously" handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man's paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts.

He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?Options: A. No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.  B. No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.  C. Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.  D.

Upheld, because his conviction would probably have been secured regardless of the admittance of his confession, and the decision was harmless error.  C. Upheld, because the confession may be admitted to impeach.  D. Reversed, because a coerced confession is never admissible.
A group of residents sued a neighboring strip club for creating a nuisance. There are continuous nightly activities by the club, including loud music, unruly customers, throwing cans and bottles,urinating in public, shouting profanities, fist-fighting, and acts of vandalism. The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures. The club defends that it cannot control its customers after they leave the premises, and it reminds the court that it has zoning approval. Its approval, however, is based on a grandfather clause that allows it as a non-conforming use  otherwise, the area surrounding the club is strictly residential. Will the court likely issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbor's problems?Options: A. No, the right of free speech granted to a strip club outweighs the minor and temporary inconvenience of the neighbors.  B. Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous  an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.  C. No, because there is no remedy for interference with use and enjoyment of land other than a tort action for trespass or to abate an abnormally dangerous condition.  D. Yes, the activities of the club constitute an attractive nuisance that interferes with the public at large and must be abated.

C. improper, because it violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  D. improper, because it violates the attorney-client privilege.
A lady owns a house in fee simple absolute, which she devises to her cousin, in trust for her grandchild, for her grandchild's life, and then to the children appointed in a will by her grandchild.

Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.  D. No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.v
A female tenant repeatedly asked her landlord to make repairs necessary for her security, but the landlord ignored her. The tenant was later robbed and beaten by an intruder. She sued the landlord for negligence in causing her injuries. The landlord relied on an exculpatory clause in the lease. The clause, set in fine print on the reverse side of the multi-paged, mass-printed, form lease, was a comprehensive, legalistic waiver in which the tenant gave up virtually all of her rights and remedies against the landlord. She responded that the clause was unconscionable and should not be enforced. What will the court most likely rule with respect to the exculpatory clause?Options: A. This is not a contract for the sale of goods  unconscionability is not available with respect to an agreement not covered by the UCC.  B. The exculpatory clause must be enforced because the tenant voluntarily signed the lease and agreed to its terms instead of choosing another place to live.  C. The clause is unenforceable because it discriminates against women who are unable to provide their own security.  D. The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.

A woman is the fee simple owner of a 1,000-acre tract of land. Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it would be land fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber and has clearings where someone could build a home and live. The woman conveyed the tract to her brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother then proceeded to clear some timber on the tract and used it in repairing fences, buildings, equipment, and the like on the property. In an action by the woman to permanently enjoin the brother from cutting any more timber on the swampland section of the tract and to account for profits received in the sale of the timber, the woman will most likelyOptions: A. succeed, because a life tenant must account for permissive waste to the reversioner or remainderman.  B. succeed, because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no such prior use had been made.  C. not succeed, because a life tenant is not liable for permissive waste.  D. not succeed, because a life tenant has a right to make reasonable use of the land.

Yes, because the nurseÕs attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.  D. Yes, because the nurseÕs complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.

Two parties entered into a contract. The one party was a one-man manufacturer's independent distrubutor and the other party was an international conglomerate that manufactured construction materials for eventual delivery to new home builders. The contracting parties got into a dispute over the terms of the contract. The choice-of-law provision mandated Delaware law for all disputes. The independent distributor sued in California where most of his business on behalf of the manufacturer was conducted. The manufacturer was based in Illinois.

Will the presiding state court have a sustainable reason for rejecting the choice-of-law provision and applying the law of the forum court?Options: A. No, there is no basis for rejecting a choice-of-law provision in a contract.  B. Yes, where there is no relationship between the chosen forum and the parties and where one side obtained a contract of adhesion, the court will not generally enforce the choice-of-law provision.  C. No, one of the parties is incorporated in Delaware and that is enough for the choice-of-law provision to be strictly adhered to.  D. Yes, the party who brings the lawsuit can designate which state's law applies regardless of the existence of a choiceof- law provision in the contract.

A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional?Options: A. No, the state law was consistent with the federal law and with federal policy on Cuba.  B. No, a state has the sovereign right to pass its own laws concerning its policies toward foreign countries.

The state constitution in one state guaranteed the right to marry to same-sex and opposite-sex couples alike. A political group got a proposition on the ballot, and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Will the court grant the requests of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry?Options: A. Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.  B. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.  C. No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.  D. No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.

A graduate of law school received notice that she had successfully passed the bar exam. To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt.

Call us to reserve your table. "The response to the promotion was more than the restaurant expected, and the restaurant was soon overbooked for the Mother's Day brunch. On the day before Mother's Day, the restaurant owner decided to double-check inventory to make sure the restaurant had enough food and supplies to handle the large Mother's Day crowd. To her horror, she discovered that the restaurant was almost out of eggs. Knowing that a large supply of eggs would be needed for the omelet station, the owner immediately sent the following e-mail to her egg supplier:"Desperately need 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for tomorrow's brunch. Money is no object. The eggs must be delivered today. "The supplier e-mailed back:"No problem! I'll load them on the truck and deliver them within the hour.

A woman owned four beach houses. Each house had star-shaped windows. As the hurricane season was approaching, she hired a carpenter to build storm windows for the star-shaped and deliver them to the four houses. Because of the unique shape of the windows, the carpenter had to do all work by hand. The carpenter and woman signed a contract under which the carpenter promised to build and deliver the storm windows to all four beach houses within 30 days, and the woman promised to pay $8,000 ($2,000 per beach house) within one week of completion of the job. Two weeks after the contract was signed, a fire destroyed the carpenter's workshop, where he was storing all the completed storm windows before delivery. The carpenter then sent a letter to the woman that read:"The fire destroyed my equipment and inventory  including the storm windows, which had been completed and which were awaiting delivery. I am dead broke and cannot complete my obligations under the contract. " The woman then telephoned the carpenter and told him, "Unless you fulfill your contractual obligations, I will sue you!"In an action for specific performance to compel the carpenter to build and deliver the storm windows, the woman will most likelyOptions: A. succeed, because the carpenter's loss of the inventory would not excuse his duty of performance.  B. succeed, because the beach houses would suffer severe damage in the event a hurricane struck without the storm windows having been installed.  C. not succeed, because the carpenter's performance would be excused by the unforeseeable act of God.  D. not succeed, because the carpenter's loss of inventory would render his performance impossible.
A state enacts a statute that will allocate funds generated by state taxes to pay for one-half of the annual salaries of teachers in private schools, whether the schools are public or private, as long as the schools satisfy the requirements established by the United States Department of Education.

C. constitutional, as nonviolative of the First Amendment's establishment clause.  D. constitutional, as being within the area of compelling state interest.
A police detective received an anonymous call that marijuana was being grown in someone's home, but no other details were given. She went to the home with an investigative team including a drug-sniffing dog. On the front porch of the home the dog began pacing back and forth frantically, which indicated smelling illegal drugs. The team retreated while some of them went to get a warrant. A warrant was issued based on the dog's behavior. The search inside revealed large quantities of marijuana. The homeowner was arrested. Through counsel, he filed a motion to suppress based on the assertion that the use of the dog was an illegal search without probable cause thus rendering the warrant invalid. Should the court suppress the evidence?Options: A. No, because the detective had probable cause after receiving the anonymous call, which justified the use of the dog for a valid search -- the warrant was thus valid and the evidence will not be suppressed.  B. No, because the detective had a right to take the dog to make a reasonable search, which led to the finding of probable cause and the issuance of a valid warrant.  C. Yes, because the anonymous call was insufficient cause to allow for a search of the front porch with the dog, which made the warrant invalid  the suppression motion will be granted.  D. Yes, because the dog's reaction did nothing to tell them that there were drugs inside  a warrant can never be based on a dog's information.

A plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries that the plaintiff suffered when he was struck by the defendant's car. At trial, the plaintiff testified that he was walking across the street inside a crosswalk at the time the defendant's car hit him. This action takes place in a jurisdiction that has a statute in effect requiring all motorists to stop and permit pedestrians to cross streets at designated crosswalks. The defendant contended that the plaintiff ran into the street outside the crosswalk. Furthermore, the defendant testified that he immediately applied his brakes when he saw the plaintiff dart into the street, but couldn't stop his car in time to avoid hitting him. In support of the defendant's testimony, the defendant calls a neighbor to testify that she has observed the plaintiff frequently during the years that she has lived on that street, and that the plaintiff "always crosses the street outside the crosswalk. "The neighbor's testimony is likely to beOptions: A. admitted, because it tends to show that the plaintiff was careless.  B. admitted, because it is probative of the plaintiff's habit of crossing the street outside the crosswalk.  C. excluded, because the neighbor was not an eyewitness to the accident.  D. excluded, because her testimony is impermissible evidence of character to show defendant's plaintiff's conduct on a particular occasion.
A state was facing a fiscal problem. In order to raise funds, the state decided to consider the creation of a state postal service that only its residents may use for intrastate mail.

In addition, any employees of the state would be able to send their mail for free through the state postal service. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the proposed legislation?Options: A.

The negative implications that flow from the delegation to Congress of the power to establish a post office prohibit such a state postal service.  C. It denies citizens of the state who are not state government employees their rights under the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  D.

A construction worker sued an insulation manufacturer in federal court, claiming that he had developed a chronic health condition as a result of 20 years of exposure to the manufacturer's insulation at his work sites. The manufacturer answered, denying all liability and stating that it had never supplied its insulation to the worker's employer. The worker's attorney deposed the manufacturer's president, and the manufacturer's attorney deposed the worker. Immediately thereafter, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the worker had no evidence showing that the insulation had ever been used by the worker's employer. What would be the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment?Options: A. Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.  B. Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.  C. Argue that the motion should be denied, because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.  D. Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.

The defendant donned a cowboy mask and entered the senior partner's office. As the senior partner was talking on the phone with his back to the door, the defendant pulled out a toy cap gun and said, "This is a stickup . . . give me your wallet or I'll shoot. " When the senior partner turned around to face the defendant, he pulled the trigger of the gun. This caused the toy pistol to make a loud noise. Although the senior partner was not frightened, he fired the defendant because of the incident, citing unprofessional conduct. The defendant was subsequently charged with criminal assault under the above mentioned statute. At trial, the defendant testified that he was only playing a practical joke on the senior partner and was trying to scare him as a harmless prank.

A county owns a large expanse of land next to the ocean. Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the land, the county leased most of it to a private company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate golf course and country club complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the golf course and country club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee is empowered to set up strict membership "standards," as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee is $5,000 and the monthly dues $75 per month. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications for Latino Men, while disapproving and denying all applications of women, African Americans, white Americans, and other minorities. A white resident of the county, upon denial of membership, brings an action against the company seeking injunctive relief to compel his admission claiming that denial of membership to white residents violates his right to equal protection. Which of the following statements is most accurate?Options: A. The company will prevail because its denial of membership lacks the requisite state action.  B. The plaintiff will win because even though the company is a privately owned corporation, the state has affirmatively encouraged or facilitated its discriminating acts.  C. The company will win, because the plaintiff lacks standing to assert the rights of discrimination against white Americans as a group.  D. The plaintiff will win, because denial of membership to white residents cannot be justified by a rational basis.
One evening, a defendant set fire to an occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed.

The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second count. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will beOptions: A. granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.  B. granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.  C. denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.  D. denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.
A housing corporation owned a tract of land and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the tract of land. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. "A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?Options: A. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.  B. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.  C. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.  D. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.
A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial artists' studios in that city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial figure drawer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city. A gallery, located in a neighboring state, has been sending two itinerant artists into the city. Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of $2. 00. The drawing is sent to a studio, which frames it and mails the framed painting to the customer. The neighboring state does not impose a tax on artists' studios. The gallery challenges the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax that is imposed upon its itinerant artists in the city. The court will most likely declare this taxOptions: A. constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.  B. constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.  C. unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.  D. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.
A mother has an 11-year-old daughter. The mother is legally separated from her husband and has filed for divorce. The mother and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother went out to dinner and left her daughter at home. Upon leaving the house, the mother locked the door to her bedroom. While the mother was gone, the daughter found a spare key to her mother's bedroom and opened the door. While rummaging through her mother's dresser, she found a bag containing white powder. Concerned that the bag might contain drugs, the daughter called her father to ask his advice. The husband instructed her to call the police. The daughter then telephoned the police station and reported what she had found. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to her home. The daughter allowed the police to come inside and led them to her mother's bedroom. She gave the officers the bag, which they took to the station house for a lab test. After the results confirmed that the bag contained cocaine, the mother was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The mother's attorney has filed a motion to prevent the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The motion should beOptions: A. denied, because the daughter, and husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.  B. denied, because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.  C. granted, because the daughter, as a minor, did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter the home.
