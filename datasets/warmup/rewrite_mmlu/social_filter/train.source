Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?Options: A. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.  B. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.  C. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.  D. Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation.

In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?Options: A. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.  B. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.  C. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.  D. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.

There is no direct return on investment in building security systems.  B. Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.  C.

In what ways may TNC be regarded as a new concept?Options: A. Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes.  B. Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.  C. Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.  D. The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime. The pursuit of profit for illicit activity eludes definition and may include those individuals or businesses that engage in occasional transnational criminal activity but are otherwise legitimate operatives.
Which of the following statements does not characterise our understanding of disease pandemics within the contemporary international political system?Options: A. Infectious disease transcends international borders and, to some extent, divisions of class, gender, education and wealth.  B. Whilst pandemics present a direct risk to national security, they also have the potential to undermine wider international stability.  C. Like terrorism, pandemics present a set of threats and risks that are diverse yet interconnected.  D. The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks.
What might the pragmatic implications of biology be on post-conflict gender security?Options: A. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their "protectors". This strengthens the argument for female soldiers to be engaged in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations.  B. Perpetuation of violence against women in post-conflict society has devalued the claim that violence is more prevalent in militarized societies. Women were as protected by men in pre-war society as they were in post-war society.  C. Case studies revealed that in certain military families, levels of violence were dependent on the degree of psychological damage inflicted during fighting, however this was variable and dependent on the individual not on gender basis.  D. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their "protectors" which may actually undermine liberal feminists' case of the "right to fight".
What is Critical Security Studies?Options: A. An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies.  B. A specific theory of security that identifies clearly defined agents, threats, and processes.  C. A secondary term for the Copenhagen School of Security.  D. A study security in which the critical importance of the state, military and traditional security are maintained.
Which of these is not a widely articulated or valid criticism of constructivism?Options: A. Constructivism lacks the ability to empirically prove its theories.  B. The rationalist foundations of constructivism create difficulties in applying its theories within a changing international system.  C. By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world.  D. Despite rejecting causality, constructivists simply replace the material trigger of causality with ideas.
How does the social constructivist approach account for the process of militarization?Options: A. By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways.  B. Social constructivists tend to focus on the population rather than military as an area for study, thus regarding the process of militarization largely in terms of its impact on human security.  C. Social constructivists assert that the process follows a popular recognition of empirically definable threats; when it is recognized that an issue poses a real and valid threat, it warrants militarization.  D. In their uniform advocacy of human security and adoption of a human-centric approach to security studies, social constructivists regard militarization as a process that is detrimental to achieving wider security goals and actively encourage the demilitarization of the security system.
Which of these statements does not describe the liberalist conception of the international system?Options: A. International politics is not the same everywhere; it is only 'realist' in certain places at certain times.  B. The nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system.  C. Nation states are not basically alike.  D. States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations.
Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?Options: A. The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.  B. The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.  C. The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.  D. Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.
What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?Options: A. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.  B. Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.  C. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.  D. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status.
In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework explain previous understandings of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions?Options: A. In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.  B. To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it. It follows that a failure to set a deadline for compliance will be interrelated as evidence that the coercer lacks the will to implement the threat.  C. Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.  D. All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.
It has been argued by Braun and Chyba (2004) that indigenous nuclear programs are making proliferation safeguards obsolete. In what ways, if any, can a case be made to support this argument?Options: A. WMD may provide the means to offset inferiority in conventional armaments compared to regional or superpower rivals. Possession of WMD may act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threat, or be used to defeat their adversaries if engaged in combat. WMD capabilities may also be developed to gain automatic status and diplomatic influence amongst the international community.  B. Although there are fears posed by WMD proliferation that terrorists may gain the capacity to develop weapons, it would remain very difficult to construct even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon. However, whilst nuclear capabilities may be elusive, international or domestic terrorist networks may have the resources to construct and use chemical, biological, and radiological weapons.  C. WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured. This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time. What separates WMD from conventional weapons is the potential to cause high level destruction. Because of the psychological fear possession can generate, WMD will remain highly desirable as a political weapon.  D. All of these options.
Which of the following statements is true within the postcolonial approach?Options: A. The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others.  B. European practices of free trade and democracy are best suited to creating a peaceful and stable international system.  C. With the end of the Second World War and gradual dissolution of the British Empire, much of postcolonialism is redundant.  D. Colonial power exists only through the military actions of occupying states.
In what ways have post-Cold War developments undermined state authority?Options: A. The increased levels of globalization in trade, finance, and movement have produced an environment conducive to TNC by making it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide service, and smuggle persons across borders.  B. The wave of political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism since the 1980s - a phenomenon which frequently occurred simultaneously in the same country - have undermined state capacity to enforce rule of law and created new opportunities for organized crime groups to penetrate societies in transition.  C. The sharp increase in civil conflicts around the globe also created a new generation of refugees. These diasporas have provided the family and ethnic ties that help facilitate a transnational criminal enterprise.  D. All of these options.
Inefficient balancing or buckpassing by states can lead to what?Options: A. An increase in non-traditional security threats.  B. A more cooperative international system.  C. A more competitive international system.  D. An increase in inter-state alliances and military restraint.
In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework provide an analytical framework for practitioners' success?Options: A. The Ideal Policy framework provides the analytical tools for understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, for example why a policymaker takes the decision to, or not to, implement the Ideal Policy.  B. The Ideal Policy framework focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.  C. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy.  D. The Ideal Policy framework recognizes that to make non-compliance too costly, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary or to deny the targets objectives. The condition for success is pivotal on the coercer's threat of force.
What techniques and targets belong to a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns?Options: A. Suicide attacks have been employed by terrorists having the advantage of enabling detonation at the last minute or when casualties will be maximized. A potential future danger is that a suicide attack could be combined with the use of chemical, biological or radiological weapons.  B. The ability to find vulnerable targets may be greater in democratic states since there are limitations on how much a government can monitor its citizen and will, in the event of an attack, generate more publicity. However, security forces in weak non-democratic countries also provide conditions conducive to terrorist activity, enabling relative freedom of operation and movement.  C. WMD have not been used very often, requiring high levels of resources and trained personnel for use. Furthermore, most terrorist groups still prefer to use more predictable methods for inflicting maximum casualties on the target. Yet to some extent, terrorist groups have gained a psychological edge because of the fear of use of WMD.  D. All of these options.
In what ways do environmental issues present a concern for peace researchers in the twenty-first century?Options: A. Environmental constraints can limit conventional economic growth, posing a direct threat to economic security and development.  B. Environmental changes, such as rising sea levels, can threaten the land on which populations are settled as well as their access to resources. Migration as a result of these changes presents threats to societal, economic and other sectors of security.  C. Environmental degradation and increased demand for resources is likely to lead to scarcity and result in conflict.  D. All of these options.
Describe the relationship between the military security domain and social constructivism.Options: A. It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.  B. Social constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based; in rejecting the empirical basis of security studies, the social constructivist approach becomes inadequate in its attempts to formulate military security theory.  C. Social constructivism is based on philosophical ideas that directly contradict the foundations of military-centred theory. The tendency is for social constructivists to dismiss military endeavours as clumsy and as being detrimental to human security.  D. In order to study military security, analysts must adopt a realist lens. However, this can later be combined with other approaches, including social constructivism, in order to consider the security of different referent objects such as the environment or human security.
How do gun shows and international arms fairs contribute to illicit arms markets?Options: A. Although the subject of vocal opposition by campaigners, gun shows employ strict legal restrictions on participants, ensuring that those with criminal records are not able to purchase weapons.  B. Gun shows are regulated to ensure that weapons purchased legally cannot be resold on the black or grey markets.  C. Gun shows and arms fairs do not contribute in a significant way to the trade in illicit arms.  D. Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used.
Which of the following was not stated as an objective of the Commission on Human Security when it was launched?Options: A. To promote public understanding, engagement and support of human security and its underlying imperatives.  B. To develop the concept of human security as an operational tool for policy formulation and implementation.  C. To propose a concrete program of action to address critical and pervasive threats to human security.  D. To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security.
In terms of cyber-security, what is meant by 'resilience' and why is it important?Options: A. Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat.  B. The only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure that it can repel all types of threat and remain and avoid attack.  C. Resilience in an IT system refers to its ability to function when there are no threats to its security.  D. Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.
Has TNC become a national security threat?Options: A. Transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development. Organized crime is seen as a threat to development insofar as it undermines the rule of law and deters foreign investment by increasing the level of insecurity in the host communities. Additionally, criminals often reinvest their proceeds in the legal economy and have unfair advantage through access to cheap capital and their ability to intimidate commercial adversaries. In societies with high levels of TNC, legitimate investors are often reluctant to commit resources.  B. TNC undermines democratic stability. In many states, transnational criminal enterprises have taken advantage of the instability that has accompanied the democratic transitions to post communist societies, using their influence in the upper reaches of the state and thus shielding themselves from law enforcement. The corruption of public institutions and the perceived inefficacy of the rule of law in new democracies contribute to undermining public confidence in and loyalty to the new regime.  C. The ability of transnational crime to evade state border controls and provide new avenues for the illicit transportation of goods and persons challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, the monopolization over the control of force, and as the provider of the common good. TNC criminal activities corrupt and undermine numerous state agencies, providing mechanisms by which their activities can affect the very nature of government and state policy in the host countries.  D. All of the above are correct.
In defining the term 'historical materialism', which of the following statements best defines the term 'materialism'?Options: A. Materialism refers to HM's focus on class and the productive basis of societies, as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change.  B. Materialism refers to the roots of HM in the postmodern schools of thought.  C. The term materialism refers to the focus of HM on consumerism and the centrality of economic power in the approach.  D. In their rejection of class orientated political interaction, HM scholars refer to wealth instead as the accumulation or access to physical resources, coining the term materialism to describe this approach.
Which of the following is not a response to the illicit arms trade?Options: A. 2001 UN Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition.  B. 2001 UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects.  C. 2001 UN Security Council Resolution 1308 on HIV/AIDS as a National Security Threat.  D. 2005 Marking and Tracing of Weapons Accord.
What are the main criticisms of the realist argument against humanitarian intervention?Options: A. Realist opposition to humanitarian intervention is based on assumptions that states will protect their citizens.  B. The realist position overlooks the responsibilities that are inherent to sovereignty.  C. Critics of humanitarian intervention overlook the wide body of international law relating to basic human rights and the consensus on grave crimes such as genocide.  D. All of these options.
Which of the following statements best describes our understanding of the term 'globalization'?Options: A. Globalization refers to the process by which shared hegemonic values pervade societies across the globe, drawing them into an ideological community, most often based on the economic principles of capitalism.  B. Best described as intensification of worldwide social relations and increasing interdependence, globalization is the result of the compression of space and time through the development of new technologies.  C. Globalization is best described as the 'shrinking' of the global community, drawing people into closer contact with one another primarily at the economic and technical levels. This process began in the early 20th century and was based on the ideological expeditions that originated from western Europe.  D. Globalization has occurred since the 1980s, originating in Western Europe as a centre of political power and technological advancement. The process is a direct result of technological advancement in communications and travel industries that facilitate the efficient transportation of physical objects, people and ideas across the globe.
In what ways may weak states be challenged externally?Options: A. Powerful states may employ diplomatic pressures to ensure that weak states comply with international norms. This may involve economic sanctions and withholding weaponry deals, which undermines the state's ability to pay or supply the army which increases the risk of army disaffection and possible coups.  B. Weak states are threatened by the proliferation of small arms which can be used in a challenge to the authority of the state. Small and light weapons are purchasable through legal and illegal channels and are prevalent in regions with warlords, criminals and private militias.  C. Weak states cannot remain isolated from processes of globalization. Increasingly porous borders lead to migration and immigration. In order to compete in a globalized market weak states look to secure financial-credit assistance or aid from international institutions. However, these processes undermine the hegemonic idea of the state and societal identity is blurred which makes it difficult for the state to sustain its ideological appeal.  D. All of these options.
Which of the following is applicable when considering the concept of security dilemmas in terms of societal identity?Options: A. For societal security dilemmas ambiguity can stem from two sides of nationalism; cultural (positive) and ethnic (negative). Ethnic (political) nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures.  B. Clear distinctions between cultural nationalism and political nationalism are difficult to make: cultural nationalism may sometimes be compelled to change itself from a solely cultural movement into a political movement and be conflated with political nationalism.  C. Dominant actors may exaggerate threat perceptions with the intent of mobilizing political support which can result in action reaction processes.  D. All of these options.
What is meant by the term 'security dilemma' and how does it impact on the international security environment?Options: A. The security dilemma can be utilised as a force for stabilising the international environment, placing all states at equal risk of military attack and discouraging a counter-productive accumulation of military force; the impact of security dilemmas is largely restricted to the realm of military security, although this can have far-reaching effects.  B. The security dilemma arises out of the anarchic international system that is conceptualized by realists. Within this environment, states are obliged to seek security through their own military efforts; this is perceived as threatening to other states and so triggers an arms race spiral. The security dilemma has implications for security sectors other than the military, particularly the political and societal security sectors.  C. The term security dilemma refers to the state of constant insecurity that is inherent to the traditional realist paradigm of international security. Security dilemmas will have most notable effects on human and societal security, typically outweighing the initial implications on traditional security domains such as the political and military sphere.  D. Security dilemmas have implications for other realms of security beside the military domain, although their effect on societal security is limited. The term primarily refers to the ways in which states conceptualize their own military capabilities with regards to those around them.
What are the types of terrorism? Are all groups the same?Options: A. Religious terrorism seems to be one of the hallmarks of the post-Cold War age. Religious terrorism is understood to denote the extremist activities of Islamic fundamentalism. Al-Qaeda is the most prominent example of religious terrorist groups and is described as globally operational, although religious terrorism is not limited to the al-Qaeda network. Christian beliefs were used to justify the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, as well as anti-abortionist assassinations in the USA.  B. Terrorist groups have drawn their ideas from ideologies. There was a wave of terrorist violence in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s rooted in various leftist and Marxist ideologies but these began to wane by the late 1980s. Right-wing groups are also present, often with overtly xenophobic and racist views, targeting migrants and foreign workers.  C. Groups defined by their ethnic or linguistic identifications are a broad category for the organization of terrorist groups. In some countries a large number of anti-colonial groups were ethnically based and used terrorist tactics in the wars of liberation. Such loyalties and tactics have in some cases proved immutable post-independence. Ethnic and linguistic affiliation has proved a powerful motivation for terrorist actions when combined with territory, and ethnic independence from another ethnic group.  D. All of the above are correct.
What kind of actors are involved in the defence trade?Options: A. The defence trade concerns legitimate business interaction between states procuring or selling military equipment.  B. Military organisations are the sole actors in the defence trade.  C. Not only state actors are involved in the defence trade. Non-state actors, including illegal groups, are also key players.  D. The defence trade refers solely to the trade in weapons and small arms that takes place outside the legal interactions between states.
How has HM developed during and since the Cold War?Options: A. During the post Cold War period there has grown an increasingly disparity between the analytical framework of security studies and HM, sidelining the latter and excluding it from mainstream study.  B. Following the popularity of HM during the Cold War it has enjoyed a gradual inclusion into security dialogue and is now considered one of the main paradigms within security studies.  C. The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies. Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has lead to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study.  D. HM was developed as an approach to security studies following the Cold War and has flourished in the proceeding security environment. It has also enjoyed reputable success thanks to its affiliation with prominent actors during the Cold War.
The following statements define the conceptualization of 'class' within HM; which is incorrect?Options: A. All advocates of HM accept that social class is important.  B. Within the HM paradigm, the only form of class that matters is social class.  C. The focus of HM lies predominantly on class and class in relation to capital.  D. HM regards class as being far more complex than a simple division between a capitalist ruling class and working class.
Why do so many feminist scholars regard the exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat as important?Options: A. Veterans of armed conflict may be rewarded by gaining powerful offices, often in political positions and in state institutions.  B. Participation in military activity is often regarded as a sign of strength, patriotism and courage.  C. The foundations for decisions not to allow female participation are commonly based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationale that can limit women's participation in civil society in other ways.  D. All of these options.
In what ways is the case for humanitarian intervention, as outlined in this chapter, limited?Options: A. It is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights.  B. Advocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the extent of global consensus about the use of force to protect human rights.  C. Any norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states.  D. All of these options.
What role does 'Information' play in the economic science of decision making?Options: A. Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process.  B. Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices.  C. Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.  D. Information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be sold and traded as a market commodity.
Which of the following did not emerge as a trend of the defence trade in the 20th century?Options: A. The arms trade shifts from being a private to a government controlled enterprise.  B. An increase in the defence trade.  C. A decrease in the arms trade.  D. A growth in the number and variety of weapons traded.
Which of these are characteristics of realist theory?Options: A. The international system is anarchic.  B. States assess one another in terms of their power and capabilities rather than their internal variations.  C. States are unitary and rational actors; sovereign states will act in a way suited to achieving their goals.  D. All of these options.
Which of these statements defines the Copenhagen School's view of security?Options: A. Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.  B. Security is best defined using the traditional paradigm, with the state as the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible.  C. To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.  D. Security exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied.
Which of these best describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity?Options: A. The inherent promotion of feminine characteristics in society.  B. Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics.  C. All of these options.  D. The acknowledgement that gender identity exists in many forms and is not binary.
How do institutional constraints affect behaviour?Options: A. Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them.  B. Institutions are the social norms and expectations that affect an actor's goals and ambitions.  C. Institutional constraints refer to tools of the state such as schools, prisons, and hospitals; the provision of resources for these institutions makes demands on political leaders.  D. Institutions are humanly devised constrains that structure human interaction, they are man-made rules that guide decision making and govern behaviour.
Which of the following policies is not true of economic policy?Options: A. Economic policies must take into account the incentives of not only the leaders, but the populations intended to influence.  B. Policymakers can incentivize security-promoting behaviours in others through the use of sanctions and aid.  C. Trade policies can entice leaders to change behaviours in exchange for access to markets or trade preferences, and advance security.  D. Concern with poverty is a humanitarian issue that has no direct link to economic science, although it might be alleviated through aid.
Which of the following is not an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian inventions?Options: A. Armed force should only ever be used in the national interest and that humanitarian intervention is therefore imprudent.  B. Foreign intervention reduces the proportion of wars that end in outright victory, it leaves behind an unstable peace that is likely to reignite.  C. Foreign intervention tends to prolong wars; it is inappropriate and does not work.  D. Humanitarian intervention prioritises the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism.
Why, in the contemporary studies of security, is the subject of energy security so important?Options: A. There exists an array of contemporary challenges to energy security, ranging from resource scarcity concerns to dangers of political instability.  B. The existence of reliable supplies of energy determines the ability of a nation to achieve economic development.  C. Energy security encompasses a broad range of issues that are both contemporary and fundamental to security, ranging from the local and individual to the global scale.  D. All of these options.
Which of the following is a legitimate threat to societal security?Options: A. Political policies designed to alter demographic characteristics of a state.  B. All of these options.  C. Legislation that criminalises certain cultural behaviours or practice.  D. The use of military force to conduct ethnic-cleansing through displacement and killing.
Which of the following conditions does not constitute 'human security'?Options: A. A condition where people are given relief from the traumas that afflict human development, are safe from threats and are protected from hurtful disruptions to their daily lives.  B. A condition in which every citizen is free from the threat of physical violence, regardless of their race, ethnicity or other identity.  C. A condition where people are guaranteed the ability to live and develop, free from political oppression or prejudice, safe from threats posed by their own or external state actors.  D. A condition where people exist independently of state support, where human life is self-sufficient in that individuals do not require the assistance of state apparatus in order to live securely.
What are the effects of nuclear weapons?Options: A. A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), "the Compton effect." EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.  B. A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects.  C. Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.  D. All of the above
Which statement best describes commercial liberalism?Options: A. Commercial liberalism is the newest and most important faction of liberalism; it advocates socialist economic principles in order to address inequalities in the distribution of wealth that threaten societal and regime security.  B. Commercial liberalism is based on the idea that free-trade directly undermines the power of the state, and argues that the market should be regulated where possible by state actors. One flaw of commercial liberalism is that it reduces cooperation and can thus increase conflict between states.  C. Commercial liberalism is probably the oldest faction of liberalism; advocating free trade as the free movement of goods and capital, it purports that the most rapid and efficient production of wealth occurs when governments do not restrict the economic activity of private actors and the free market.  D. Commercial liberalism advocates the restraint of private enterprise and non-governmental activity in the economic sphere, arguing that interference will hinder economic prosperity.
Security studies can be interpreted as an imperial field of knowledge in which of the following ways?Options: A. Security studies emerged in relation to the interests of the USA and Britain following the Second World War.  B. Security studies adopts a perspective which postcolonial scholars refer to as 'the colonizer's view of the world'.  C. Security studies was originally defined by the power of the USA and Britain at a time when they actively supported colonial and imperial relations in the global south.  D. All of these options.
What do critics fear would be the result of granting rights of humanitarian intervention?Options: A. An abuse of this power in order to wage state-interested wars.  B. A depletion of military resources pursuing wars on ethical grounds, leading to a loss of military security.  C. Whilst some states have proven their ability to conduct 'just' wars in order to protect sound values of democracy and neoliberalism, not all states would use force to pursue such globally beneficial ends.  D. A lack of implementation of these rights by state actors, leading to a failure to address human rights abuses.
In what ways did the Human Development Report, published by the United Nations Development Program in 1994, challenge the traditional security paradigm?Options: A. The report outlined seven areas or components of human security that policymakers should henceforth devote greater political attention and capital to: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security.  B. The report highlighted the considerable burden that infectious diseases continue to pose in the developing world-including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.  C. The report advocates a framework of human security analysis that aims to redress the perceived imbalance in security thinking that has been predominant in traditional security studies.  D. All of these options.
In what ways might international measures be employed? Are they a help or a hindrance?Options: A. Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker.  B. A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents.  C. Intelligence agencies are highly centralized, organized structures that operate at a maximum functional level within their domestic context. There is no reason to presume that collaboration would enhance their ability to contribute to the prevention of terrorism. The multi-agency approach would also broaden the scope for potential errors, miscommunication, and intelligence failures.  D. Multi-partner initiatives to support the reforms necessary for the prevention of terrorism have proved ineffective. Sanctions against countries that provide a territorial base for terrorism may be misplaced, having negligible effects on the terrorist organizations themselves.
According to Krause and Williams, what agenda would most likely attract scholars to the 'broad church' of security studies?Options: A. To question the referent object, to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and to change the way in which security is studied.  B. To address security from a positivist perspective, challenging the dominance of traditional security paradigms, and shifting academic attention to the individual as a referent point.  C. To question the dominance of liberalism and realism in the international system, to apply critical knowledge to the security dilemma faced by states and to redress the power imbalances that lead to intra-state conflict.  D. To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects.
What is the significance of anarchy to the realist explanation of international politics?Options: A. Anarchy means that the state exists as part of society being indistinguishable from national government and the domestic character of the state.  B. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour.  C. Anarchy means that there is little continuity in a government's foreign policy over time. Leaders come and go and their foreign policy changes, which is reflective of different preoccupations and ideologies.  D. Anarchy means that the structure of the international system is distinctive because states have a strong sense that they are part of a larger entity in international politics with overarching interests and goals, making association unlimited and important.
Which of the following ideas have become mainstreamed within human security since the Human Development Report?Options: A. Limiting security analysis to military engagement is too restrictive.  B. Security is a contestable concept.  C. Focusing security only on violent conflicts is too restrictive.  D. All of these options.
Which of the statements below is not one of the eight themes of post-Marxist critical security theory identified by Ken Booth as being important to critical security theory?Options: A. All knowledge is a social process.  B. The test of theory is emancipation.  C. Human society is a constant and unchanging phenomenon.  D. Human society is its own invention.
Which statement best defines the term 'international regime' in relation to liberalism?Options: A. The term international regime refers to the governmental or political apparatus that defines the state within the international system.  B. The term refers to a set of formal or informal principles to which governmental actors subscribe in their decision-making on a particular subject.  C. International regimes are independent bodies established by a collaboration of governmental and non-state actors to oversee international decision-making processes.  D. International regimes are also known as international organisations and play a fundamental role as lobbyists, advocating the views of interest groups to state actors.
How does the preoccupation with human rights affect the human rights orientated school of liberalism?Options: A. Modern human rights oriented liberalism is concerned with self-determination.  B. Human rights orientated liberalism will advocate separatism where conflict and bloodshed seem inevitable without it.  C. Human rights orientated liberalism is particularly focused on persons subject to economic, sexual, gender, religious, and political persecution, discrimination, or deprivation.  D. All of these options.
What are the specific elements of a comprehensive national defence trade control system?Options: A. Governments should include in their arms trade rules, laws, penalties for their violation.  B. Governments should ensure that weapons producers mark their defence items with a unique marking.  C. Government police and military forces should establish appropriate weapons stockpile security measures and national authorities should collect and destroy old, outdated, and excess weaponry.  D. All of these options.
Which of the following are Schelling's necessary conditions for compellence success?Options: A. The coercer must not unduly threaten the adversary; threat must be credible; adversary must recognise the legitimacy of coercer's demands; coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands; conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game.  B. Conveyed threat must be sufficient so as to make non-compliance unbearable; threat must be credible; adversary must be given sufficient time to comply with demand; coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands; conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game.  C. Conveyed threat must be sufficient so as to make non-compliance unbearable; threat must be credible; adversary must be given sufficient time to comply with demand; coercer must not use fear to coerce the adversary.  D. Conveyed threat must be sufficient so as to make non-compliance unbearable; threat must not include military intervention; adversary must be given sufficient time to comply with demand; coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands; conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game.
Which of the following characteristics describe 'Category B' agents, as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control?Options: A. Category B agents are those that present little to no risk or morbidity within infected populations, but can have detrimental effects on the ability of a group to perform physical tasks.  B. Unlike Category A agents, B agents refer to emerging security threats which have the potential to be utilised as biological weapons after further development.  C. Category B agents include food and water security threats, with moderate morbidity rates.  D. Category B agents are characterised by high mortality rates and include agents which are difficult to treat medically.
Considering Wendt's three cultures of anarchy; which of the following defines the Lockean culture?Options: A. A culture that exists some of the time, but not all the time, in which no self-restraint exists and actors cannot rely on each other for help.  B. A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.  C. A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security.  D. A culture within which survival relies on military power, security dilemmas abound, and security is a zero-sum game.
In what ways is gender applicable to the field of Security Studies?Options: A. Women and children are dependent on the state for protection and Security Studies should include them and account for their needs.  B. Biological differences between men and women determine their suitability for different roles in protecting the state or referent object.  C. Gender is not applicable to Security Studies - to create a 'gender neutral' security arena we should disregard gender issues.  D. Social constructions of 'masculinity' or 'femininity' determine the roles in which men and women are expected to act, by considering these artificial roles we can ask important questions about the ways in which we conceptualize security.
Given current patterns of industrial development, what are the future prospects for energy security?Options: A. Whilst energy consumption is correlated to levels of industrialisation, developed states of the North continue to increase their demands for energy. This is balanced by a lesser demand from states in the South; due to their lack of industrialisation their demands on energy are forecast to remain low.  B. Energy demand in the industrialised states has peaked in recent years and data indicates that consumption levels in the North have become constant and are not likely to increase.  C. Whilst forecasts predict that energy consumption in the industrialised states of the North will continue to increase, the major increase in demand will come from the developing states of the South, posing major challenges to global energy security.  D. Although demand from developing states is set to increase the global consumption of dwindling energy resources, technological advancements in alternative energy sources, coupled with comprehensive understanding of current resource levels and access, will secure energy supply in the foreseeable future.
How might weapons belonging to state military or police forces arrive on the illicit arms market?Options: A. States are strong enough to ensure that their weaponry is kept within their control and not traded illegally.  B. There is no evidence to suggest that state-owned weapons could be traded illicitly as part of the black or grey arms markets.  C. Illegal trading by states is the primary way in which weapons purchased legally might end up on the illegal arms market.  D. Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured.
In what ways has human security been significant as a concept?Options: A. Human security has put particular emphasis on the nexus between conflict and development, a concept which is very useful. The significance of the nexus between development and conflict is not just that it raises ethical issues about human suffering and inequalities, but that its frequent outcomes, so called state future, has dire local, regional, and global effects.  B. From a normative perspective, the concept serves to highlight good global norms. Human security often serves as an umbrella norm. Developing good global norms is not only important for moral and ethical reasons but also because they serve to enhance state and international society.  C. The development of the human security concept highlights the view that the threats to humans as well as to state entities are changing and increasing. These changes have spurred debates about the meaning of security and the arguments for its broadening and deepening. Like internal violence, these transnational issues have serious local, regional, and global effects.  D. All of these options.
Which of the following is an impact of common structural adjustment policies on the poor?Options: A. Cost of imports soar, including vital resources such as imported medicines. Basic food prices rise, putting even greater pressure on already stretched household budgets.  B. Reduced health, education, and social welfare spending and the introduction of cost-recovery and user-fees put healthcare and education beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors.  C. Massive redundancies and increased unemployment with no social security provision push families deeper into poverty. Farmers and small companies can no longer afford to borrow money and are forced to reduce production or go out of business.  D. All of these options.
Which of the following statements best describes the process of 'medicalization'?Options: A. The term 'medicalization' refers to the process whereby a medical or health issue becomes securitized.  B. 'Medicalization' is the outcome of security dialogue that discusses threats or risks to national security in terms of medical language.  C. An issue is said to be 'medicalized' when it is dismissed as a security threat, instead deemed to be a medical issue concerning health as mutually exclusive from security.  D.

What is the 'security dilemma' that faces weak states?Options: A. The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.  B. The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.  C. The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.  D. Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.

All of these options.
In what ways may the security dimensions of infectious disease be considered in the national security framework?Options: A. The physical health of armed forces is a paramount concern within the traditional security paradigm, and the threat of disease is exacerbated by the physical and sociological conditions under which military personal operate, particularly during combat.  B. The innate human fear of microbes makes them particularly amenable to being portrayed not just as important health issues, but as national-security threats as well.  C.

In what ways have feminist and critical security investigations of the 1980s and 1990s expanded our understanding of gender security issues?Options: A. Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.  B. Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.  C. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.  D. The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.
What preventative security measures might a government take in defence of a potential future terrorist attack?Options: A. Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime).  B. Large terrorist organizations are hard to penetrate, being highly cohesive and centralized in structure. In both the warfare and criminal model, intelligence is obtained by two methods; firstly to elicit information from captured terrorists or secondly from an informer within the group. An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised.  C. Prevention of terrorism is a highly controversial policy designed to reduce the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. The method is characterized by diplomatic exchanges. However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics.  D. Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control.
What are the challenges for the future of security studies?Options: A. The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast- rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue.  B. The fate of security studies depends on its ability to prevail in the general debates in the discipline of IR. It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates.  C. Both the US and European analysts will be working on the role and nature of technology, globalization, risk society and the international economic order. This picture shows that there will be a lot of points of contact between the currently disconnected fields of theory.  D. All of these options.
