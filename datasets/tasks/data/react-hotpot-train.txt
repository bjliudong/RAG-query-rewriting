His songs for the group include "Taxman", "Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something". Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; subsequent influences were Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry..

The Library Journal rated the film favorably, writing "This grim exploration of our toxic legacy doesn't spare mine owners, bureaucrats, or politicians. Although regulations are much stricter today, viewers will ask themselves whether any agency is willing or able to remediate former mine sites properly."[4] The Journalism & Mass Communication Educator wrote a predominantly positive review where they praised the film for its attention to personal details while also noting "The film’s interviews are striking, but lack a sense of coherence."[5] The Capital Times was slightly more mixed in their review, stating "Myers is a folksy and poetic narrator, although the tone of the film gets needlessly preachy toward the end.

Observation 3: Robert I (11 July 1274 – 7 June 1329), popularly known as Robert the Bruce (Scottish Gaelic: Raibeart an Bruis), was King of Scots from 1306 to his death in 1329.[1] One of the most renowned warriors of his generation, Robert eventually led Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent kingdom and is now revered in Scotland as a national hero.. Robert was a fourth great-grandson of King David I, and his grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the "Great Cause".[1]. As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the Scottish throne and took part in William Wallace's revolt against Edward I of England. Appointed in 1298 as a Guardian of Scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne, John Comyn of Badenoch, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews, Robert resigned in 1300 because of his quarrels with Comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of John Balliol to the Scottish throne.
Thought 4: Robert the Bruce was not an America colonial frontiersman. He was a King of Scotland.

Following My Bloody Valentine's dissolution in the late 1990s, Shields became a frequent guest musician, producer, engineer, and remixer with various bands and artists, including Experimental Audio Research, Yo La Tengo, Dinosaur Jr, and Mogwai. In 1998 he became a touring member of Primal Scream. Shields contributed several original compositions to the soundtrack of Sofia Coppola's 2003 film Lost in Translation, which earned him nominations for British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) awards.[3][4] In 2008, Shields released a collaborative live album together with Patti Smith entitled The Coral Sea..

The airport opened in 1951 and took over existing scheduled airline traffic to Fairbanks, which had previously used Ladd Army Airfield.[4] Alaska Airlines used Fairbanks as its main hub in the 1950s, with service to Seattle and Portland as well as intrastate service to Anchorage, Nome and other destinations.[5] By 1967, however, the airline shifted its Alaska hub to Anchorage; its Anchorage-Fairbanks service continues to this day.[6] In the mid-1970s, following the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Alaska Airlines and Braniff International offered "interchange service" between Fairbanks and Houston via Anchorage, Seattle and Dallas.[7] In 1982, following airline deregulation, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines began a similar interchange service using Boeing 727s.[8]. Pan American World Airways had also served Fairbanks since 1932. The station was originally opened after the acquisition of Pacific International Airways and used for short-haul services to Juneau, Seattle, Ketchikan, Whitehorse and other destinations.[9] Pan Am intended to use Fairbanks as a stop for service to Asia as early as 1931, but initial difficulty in negotiating landing rights with the Soviet Union, followed by the outbreak of World War II, delayed these plans until decades later. Pan Am service to Fairbanks continued through the opening of FAI until 1965, when the Civil Aeronautics Board terminated Pan Am's rights to serve Alaska.[10].

Observation 2: Spartacus (Greek: Σπάρτακος Spártakos; Latin: Spartacus; c. 103–71 BC) was a Thracian gladiator who, along with Crixus, Gannicus, Castus, and Oenomaus, was one of the escaped slave leaders in the Third Servile War, a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Little is known about him beyond the events of the war, and surviving historical accounts are sometimes contradictory. All sources agree that he was a former gladiator and an accomplished military leader.. This rebellion, interpreted by some as an example of oppressed people fighting for their freedom against a slave-owning oligarchy, has provided inspiration for many political thinkers, and has been featured in literature, television, and film.[2] The philosopher Voltaire described the Third Servile War as "the only just war in history".[3] Although this interpretation is not specifically contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions that the goal was to end slavery in the Republic.[4].

Executive producers Steven S. DeKnight and Robert Tapert focused on structuring the events of Spartacus' obscure early life leading up to the beginning of historical records.[2]. After the completion of the first season titled Spartacus: Blood and Sand, production for another season was delayed because lead actor Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma so Starz produced a six-episode prequel miniseries entitled Spartacus: Gods of the Arena.

Over the years there has been much confusion about the regional pronunciation of "Arkansas", which locals render as /ɑːrˈkænzəs/ rather than /ˈɑːrkənsɔː/.[6]  Throughout much of Kansas, residents use this alternative pronunciation when referring to the Arkansas River, as well as Arkansas Street in the city of Wichita.. Present-day Arkansas City sits on the site of an ancestral Wichita city, Etzanoa, which flourished from 1450 to 1700 and had an estimated population of 20,000.[7].

The band's music is a fusion of Delta blues, gypsy jazz, 1930s–era swing, klezmer, and other styles.[1] They found commercial success during the swing revival of the late 1990s with their 1996 single "Hell", written by Tom Maxwell. After a hiatus of several years, the original band members reunited and performed in 2007, playing in the U.S. and Canada..

As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]. Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass.

Vogt (comparative religion); and sociologist Alex Inkeles (Soviet studies and national character). Other prominent scholars, such as Jerome Kagan (developmental psychology) and Ezra Vogel (East Asia studies and sociology) belonged to the department early in their careers before it split. Many of the department's graduate students also went on to be major figures in US social sciences during the latter part of the twentieth century; their work tends towards strong interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary approaches..

Observation 2: Closing Time is a 1994 novel by Joseph Heller, written as a sequel to his popular 1961 novel Catch-22. It takes place in New York City in the 1990s and revisits some characters of the original, including Yossarian, Milo Minderbinder, and Chaplain Tappman.. The book has two stories that are interwoven throughout: that of Yossarian in the last stages of his life, and that of Sammy Singer and Lew Rabinowitz, two men from Coney Island who also fought in World War II (the Sammy Singer character makes a brief appearance in Catch-22 as the tailgunner aboard Yossarian's bomber who kept waking up and fainting when he saw Yossarian trying to attend to the wounds of Snowden).. As with Catch-22, the topic of death is omnipresent, only in this case from usually age-related illnesses, in particular cancer rather than dying in battle, as with its predecessor. One notable inconsistency in the book is that although Yossarian was 28 in Catch-22, which took place in 1944, in Closing Time Yossarian is 68, and the time of Catch-22 is referred to as "50 years ago".

Action 1: Search[Nirvana]
Observation 1: Nirvāṇa (/nɪərˈvɑːnə/ neer-VAH-nə, /-ˈvænə/ -⁠VAN-ə, /nɜːr-/ nur-;[1] Sanskrit: निर्वाण nirvāṇa [nɪɽʋaːɳɐ]; Pali: nibbāna; Prakrit: ṇivvāṇa; literally, "blown out", as in an oil lamp[2]) is a concept in Indian religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism) that represents the ultimate state of soteriological release, the liberation from duḥkha, suffering, and saṃsāra, the cycle of birth and rebirth.[3][web 1][4]. In Indian religions, nirvana is synonymous with moksha and mukti.[note 1] All Indian religions assert it to be a state of perfect quietude, freedom, highest happiness as well as the liberation from attachment and worldly suffering and the ending of samsara, the round of existence.[6][7] However, non-Buddhist and Buddhist traditions describe these terms for liberation differently.[8] In Hindu philosophy, it is the union of or the realization of the identity of Atman with Brahman, depending on the Hindu tradition.[9][10][11] In Jainism, nirvana is also the soteriological goal, representing the release of a soul from karmic bondage and samsara.[12] In the Buddhist context, nirvana refers to realization of non-self and emptiness, marking the end of rebirth by stilling the fires that keep the process of rebirth going.[8][13][14] To achieve this status, one has to get rid of three psychological evils – Raga (greed, desire), Dwesha (anger) and Moha (delusion).. The ideas of spiritual liberation, with the concept of soul and Brahman, appear in Vedic texts and Upanishads, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.[15]. The term nirvana in the soteriological sense of "blown out, extinguished" state of liberation appears at many places in Vedas particularly in Bhagavata Purana, however populist opinion does not give credit to either the Vedas or the Upanishads. Erroneously Collins states, "the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it nirvana."[16] This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.[17] Collins says the word nirvāṇa is from the verbal root vā "blow" in the form of past participle vāna "blown", prefixed with the preverb nis meaning "out".
Thought 2: The search result is not relevant to the question. I need to search Nirvana (band) instead.
Action 2: Search[Nirvana (band)]
Observation 2: Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, and then recruited Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.. In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.

40180 Question: What film genre does Marx Reloaded and Bitter Jester have in common?Thought 1: I need to search Marx Reloaded and Bitter Jester, find their film genre, and compare them.
Action 1: Search[Marx Reloaded]
Observation 1: Marx Reloaded is a 2011 German documentary film written and directed by the British writer and theorist Jason Barker. Featuring interviews with several well-known philosophers, the film aims to examine the relevance of Karl Marx's ideas in relation to the Great Recession.[3][4][5][6] The film's title is a wordplay on The Matrix Reloaded, the sequel to The Matrix, which is parodied in the documentary.. According to the film's website, "Marx Reloaded … examines the relevance of German socialist philosopher Karl Marx's ideas for understanding the global economic and financial crisis of 2008–09." The film also considers, in the context of an alleged revival of Marxist thinking, whether "communism might provide the solution to the growing economic and environmental challenges facing the planet".[7]. In an interview with Verso Books, writer-director Jason Barker described his intention in making the film "to reload or reimagine Marx as a thinker, without the usual totalitarian moralising." Barker criticised the "cliché" according to which "Marx's diagnoses of capitalism are validated whereas his 'prescription' of communism is rubbished on the grounds that it's 'utopian'." Asked whether the renewed popularity of Marx is evidence of a return of communism as a political force, or "just the spectre of Marx haunting the academies", Barker replied that "political thinking today is again converging on precisely the type of social conditions in which Marx lived."[8]. In a separate interview, Barker also discussed the film's use of animation, in particular his decision to parody The Matrix, admitting that although it was an "obvious parody" and "fun to make", there was also a philosophical dimension to the animation scenes in which Marx meets Leon Trotsky and Slavoj Žižek.[9].

Oaths of allegiance were made to the emperor or empress and the lawful successors by the governors-general, princes, governors, commissioners in India in events such as imperial durbars..

The ATP was developed during the 1980s, events such as such as the 1979 oil crisis and increasing public concern regarding aircraft noise led to business planners at British Aerospace to believe that there was a market for a short-range, low-noise, fuel-efficient turboprop aircraft. First flown on 6 August 1986, by the time it became commercially available, the market segment it fell within was already hotly contested by multiple other airliners, such as the de Havilland Canada Dash 8, ATR 42, and ATR 72. Amid this intense competition, sales of the ATP were limited, leading British Aerospace to terminate production after only eight years, during which a total of 65 aircraft were completed..

Observation 1: The history of Russia begins with the histories of the East Slavs.[1][2] The traditional start-date of specifically Russian history is the establishment of the Rus' state in the north in 862, ruled by Varangians.[3][4][5] Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod became the first major cities of the new union of immigrants from Scandinavia with the Slavs and Finns. In 882, Prince Oleg of Novgorod seized Kiev, thereby uniting the northern and southern lands of the Eastern Slavs under one authority, moving the governance center to Kiev by the end of the 10th century, and maintaining northern and southern parts with significant autonomy from each other. The state adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state due to the Mongol invasions in 1237–1240 along with the resulting deaths of significant numbers of the population, and with the numerous principalities being forced to accept the overlordship of the Mongols.. After the 13th century, Moscow became a political and cultural magnet for the unification of Russian lands.

Observation 4: The University of Cambridge is composed of 31 colleges in addition to the academic departments and administration of the central university. Until the mid-19th century, both Cambridge and Oxford comprised a group of colleges with a small central university administration, rather than universities in the common sense. Cambridge's colleges are communities of students, academics and staff – an environment in which generations and academic disciplines are able to mix, with both students and fellows experiencing "the breadth and excellence of a top University at an intimate level".[1]. Cambridge colleges provide most of the accommodation for undergraduates and postgraduates at the university. At the undergraduate level they have responsibility for admitting students to the university, providing pastoral support, and organising elements of their tuition, though lectures and examinations are organised by the faculties and departments of the central university.

The college is notable as the only one founded by Cambridge townspeople:[5] it was established in 1352 by the Guild of Corpus Christi and the Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary,[6] making it the sixth-oldest college in Cambridge. With around 250 undergraduates and 200 postgraduates, it also has the second smallest student body of the traditional colleges of the University, after Peterhouse.. The College has traditionally been one of the more academically successful colleges in the University of Cambridge.

Actor Dulé Hill said he decided to audition for the role due to the involvement of Martin Sheen (who portrayed President Bartlet) and show creator Aaron Sorkin, whose work he admired.[3] In preparing for the role, Hill met with his character's real-life counterpart, Kris Engskov, then personal aide to President Bill Clinton.

48252 Question: In between German Pinscher and Berger Blanc Suisse who got the full acceptance to AKC in 2003?Thought 1: I need to search German Pinscher and Berger Blanc Suisse, find the year they got full acceptance to AKC, and compare them.
Action 1: Search[German Pinscher]
Observation 1: The German Pinscher or Deutscher Pinscher is a German breed of terrier in the  Pinscher and Schnauzer group.[3][1]: 218  It shares common origins with the Schnauzer, of which it is essentially a short-haired equivalent.[4] It is seen in two colours, either black-and-tan or self-coloured red, this varying from deer-red to a dark reddish brown.[2]. It is an endangered breed, and is listed in category III of the Rote Liste of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen.[5] It is a distinct and separate breed from the Affenpinscher, the Austrian Pinscher and the Miniature Pinscher or Zwergpinscher.. The origins of the German Pinscher are unknown.[6] Dogs of this type, both rough-haired and smooth-haired, were traditionally kept as carriage dogs or as stable dogs, and so were sometimes known as Stallpinscher; they were capable ratters.[6] Both types were known as Deutscher Pinscher, and came from the same lineage; rough-haired and smooth-haired puppies could occur in the same litter.[6] The rough-haired Pinscher, which would later become the Standard Schnauzer, was also known as the Rattler.[6][7]: 152. The "smooth Pinscher" is mentioned by Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach in 1836.[6] In 1880 the Pinscher was recorded in the Deutschen Hundestammbuch of the Verein zur Veredelung der Hunderassen.[8] In 1895 Ludwig Beckmann [de] described five varieties of Pinscher – the rough- and smooth-haired Pinscher, the rough- and smooth-haired Miniature Pinscher, and the Affenpinscher; of the smooth-haired Pinscher he says that it is becoming less common, and is not often seen at dog shows.[6] In 1895 a breed society, the Pinscher-Schnauzer-Klub, was established for both types, both rough- and smooth-haired.[8]. The Pinscher almost disappeared in the years after the Second World War.
Thought 2: I need to search Berger Blanc Suisse.
Action 2: Search[Berger Blanc Suisse]
Observation 2: The White Swiss Shepherd Dog or Berger Blanc Suisse (German: Weisser Schweizer Schäferhund, Italian: Pastore Svizzero Bianco) is a Swiss breed of shepherd dog. It descends from North American White Shepherds imported to Switzerland; the White Shepherd itself descends from white-coloured purebred German Shepherds.. White-coated German Shepherds were once barred from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the colouration remained popular; a breed club was formed and these white dogs came to be recognised as a distinct breed, the White Shepherd.[2]: 104. The Berger Blanc Suisse derives from dogs of this type imported from North America to Switzerland from the early 1970s. The first of these was an American dog named Lobo, born on 5 March 1966; other dogs were imported from Canada and from the United States.[2]: 104 [3].

Thought 5: I need to search American Kennel Club and find the year of full acceptance of German Pinscher and Berger Blanc Suisse.
Action 5: Search[American Kennel Club]
Observation 5: The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a registry of purebred dog pedigrees in the United States. In addition to maintaining its pedigree registry, this kennel club also promotes and sanctions events for purebred dogs, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, an annual event which predates the official forming of the AKC, the National Dog Show and the AKC National Championship. The AKC is a non-member partner with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.[1] The AKC recognizes 200 dog breeds, as of 2022.[update]. In the early 1800s, the English became concerned with the beauty of dogs as well as their function.[2] This fad spread to North America, and in 1877, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show began.[2] Soon after, the need for a regulating body became obvious. The National American Kennel Club, which had been founded in 1876, began to publish and make publicly available its studbook in 1879.[2] This organization, however, had a more vested interest in field trials than in conformation shows, and eventually changed its name to the National Field Trial Association and stopped hosting conformation shows completely.[2].

The show's comedy sketches, which often parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members.

During this period, he almost always strapped her to a child's toilet or bound her in a crib with her arms and legs immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished.[4][5][6] The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles County child welfare authorities in November 1970, when she was 13 years and 7 months old, after which she became a ward of the state of California.[1][4][7].

The dialogue between the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse Þrymskviða from the Elder Edda; the giant Þrymr had stolen Mjölner, Thor's hammer, and demanded Freyja as his bride for its return.

(2000), No Country for Old Men (2007), True Grit (2010), Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018).

A planet retains an atmosphere when the gravity is great and the temperature of the atmosphere is low. A stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star, which includes the layers above the opaque photosphere; stars of low temperature might have outer atmospheres containing compound molecules.. The atmosphere of Earth is composed of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%) and trace gases.[2] Most organisms use oxygen for respiration; lightning and bacteria perform nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia that is used to make nucleotides and amino acids; plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.

Observation 1: Andy Williams' Greatest Hits Vol. 2 is a compilation album by American pop singer Andy Williams that was released in June 1973 by Columbia Records.[4] This collection follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, Andy Williams' Greatest Hits, in that it is not limited to his biggest and most recent hit singles, although his final two US Top 40 entries ("(Where Do I Begin) Love Story" and "Speak Softly Love (Love Theme from 'The Godfather')") were included.[5] It also has an album track not released as a single ("The Impossible Dream (The Quest)"), a couple of hits from his time with Cadence Records ("Lonely Street" and "The Village of St. Bernadette"), two other singles that could have been included on the first volume ("In the Arms of Love" and "Music to Watch Girls By"), and two Easy Listening chart entries that never made the Billboard Hot 100 ("Home Lovin' Man" and "Music from Across the Way").[5][6]. The front and back cover design for the LP (by Anne Garner and Norman Seeff) shows Williams as he is bursting through a wall-sized collage of black-and-white images from various periods of his career, mainly involving the Williams Brothers and his variety program. While the front cover does not show the one foot that it would seem he is standing on, the back cover depicts the front cover setpiece as seen from the reverse angle behind him and is shot so that neither foot is touching the floor, as if to suggest that Williams is literally flying through the wall..

Action 1: Search[Guðrøðr Óláfsson]
Observation 1: Guðrøðr Óláfsson (died 10 November 1187) was a twelfth-century ruler of the kingdoms of Dublin and the Isles.[note 1] Guðrøðr was a son of Óláfr Guðrøðarson and Affraic, daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. Throughout his career, Guðrøðr battled rival claimants to the throne, permanently losing about half of his realm to a rival dynasty in the process. Although dethroned for nearly a decade, Guðrøðr clawed his way back to regain control of a partitioned kingdom, and proceeded to project power into Ireland. Although originally opposed to the English invasion of Ireland, Guðrøðr adeptly recognised the English ascendancy in the Irish Sea region and aligned himself with the English. All later kings of the Crovan dynasty descended from Guðrøðr..

Observation 3: (Result 2 / 10) According to the chronicle, Somairle's fleet numbered eighty ships, and when the fighting concluded, the feuding brothers-in-law divided the Kingdom of the Isles between themselves.[92][note 6] Although the precise partitioning is unrecorded and uncertain, the allotment of lands seemingly held by Somairle's descendants in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries could be evidence that he and his son gained the southernmost islands of the Hebrides, whilst Guðrøðr retained the northernmost.[95] Two years later the chronicle reveals that Somairle, with a fleet of fifty-three ships, attacked Mann and drove Guðrøðr from the kingship into exile.[96] According to the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga, the contemporary Orcadian warlord Sveinn Ásleifarson had connections in the Isles, and overcame Somairle in battle at some point in the twelfth century.
Thought 4: It does not mention the island that he ruled over. So I need to look up island again.

Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928), the songs "Swanee" (1919) and "Fascinating Rhythm" (1924), the jazz standards "Embraceable You" (1928) and "I Got Rhythm" (1930), and the opera Porgy and Bess (1935), which included the hit "Summertime".. Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell, and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and with Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris, intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, but she refused him, afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style; Maurice Ravel voiced similar objections when Gershwin inquired about studying with him.

He was also responsible, along with DuBose Heyward, for the libretto to George's opera Porgy and Bess.. The success the Gershwin brothers had with their collaborative works has often overshadowed the creative role that Ira played. His mastery of songwriting continued after George's early death in 1937.

As an engineer and inventor, he improved the design of telescopes and invented the pendulum clock, a breakthrough in timekeeping and the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years. An exceptionally talented mathematician and physicist, Huygens was the first to idealize a physical problem by a set of mathematical parameters,[9] and the first to fully mathematize a mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon.[10] For these reasons, he has been called the first theoretical physicist and one of the founders of modern mathematical physics.[11][12]. Huygens first identified the correct laws of elastic collision in his work De Motu Corporum ex Percussione, completed in 1656 but published posthumously in 1703.[13] In 1659, Huygens derived geometrically the formula in classical mechanics for the centrifugal force in his work De vi Centrifuga, a decade before Newton.[14] In optics, he is best known for his wave theory of light, which he described in his Traité de la Lumière (1690). His theory of light was initially rejected in favour of Newton's corpuscular theory of light, until Augustin-Jean Fresnel adopted Huygens's principle to give a complete explanation of the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light in 1821.

1305 Question: The European Democrat Union includes the members whose ideology includes which ideology that is mostly based on ethical liberalism?Thought 1: I need to search European Democrat Union, find the members whose ideology includes ethical liberalism, then find the ideology that is mostly based on ethical liberalism.
Action 1: Search[European Democrat Union]
Observation 1: The European Democrat Union (EDU) is one of the three European wings of the International Democrat Union, along with the European People's Party (EPP) and the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE).[1] Its members include Christian democratic, liberal conservative, and conservative political parties. It is only a nominal sub-entity of the IDU, since it ceased its activities in 2002.[citation needed]. Most EDU members were also members of the EPP, but the group also included 'unattached' conservatives that are unaffiliated to the EPP.[2] These were: the British Conservative Party, the Czech Civic Democratic Party, the Icelandic Independence Party, and the Liechtenstein Patriotic Union and Progressive Citizens' Party.[3][failed verification]. In the late 1990s, the last Chairman of an independent EDU, Finnish conservative politician Sauli Niinistö, negotiated the merger of the EDU into the EPP.[4] In October 2002, the EDU ceased its activities after being formally absorbed by the EPP at a special event in Estoril, Portugal.[5][failed verification]  In recognition of his efforts, Niinistö was elected Honorary President of the EPP in the same year. Moreover, in April 2008, the EPP was recognized as a Regional Union by the IDU..
Thought 2: The European Democrat Union is not active anymore and it was absorbed by the European People's Party. So I need to search European People's Party and find the members whose ideology includes ethical liberalism.
Action 2: Search[European People's Party]
Observation 2: The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party with Christian-democratic,[4] conservative,[5][6] and liberal-conservative[4] member parties. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties. Founded by primarily Christian-democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives.[6][7][8][9][10] On 31 May 2022, the party elected as its President Manfred Weber, who was also EPP's Spitzenkandidat in 2019.. The EPP has been the largest party in the European Parliament since 1999 and in the European Council since 2002. It is also the largest party in the current European Commission.
Thought 3: The European People's Party is a European political party with Christian-democratic, conservative, and liberal-conservative member parties. So I need to search ethical liberalism and find the ideology that is mostly based on ethical liberalism.
Action 3: Search[ethical liberalism]
Observation 3: Could not find ethical liberalism. Similar: ['Conservative liberalism', 'Ethics (redirect from Ethical)', 'Classical liberalism', 'Liberalism', 'Ethical socialism'].
Thought 4: I need to search Conservative liberalism and find the ideology that is mostly based on ethical liberalism.
Action 4: Search[Conservative liberalism]
Observation 4: Conservative liberalism or right-liberalism[1][2] is a variant of liberalism, combining liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or simply representing the right-wing of the liberal movement.[3] In the case of modern "conservative liberalism", scholars sometimes see it as a more positive and less radical variant of classical liberalism, but it is also referred to as an individual tradition that distinguishes it from classical liberalism and social liberalism.[4][5] Conservative liberal parties tend to combine economically liberal policies with more traditional stances and personal beliefs on social and ethical issues.[specify][6]. In general, liberal conservatism and conservative liberalism have different philosophical roots. Historically, "liberal conservatism" refers mainly to the case where conservatives embrace the elements of classical liberalism, and "conservative liberalism" refers to classical liberals who support a laissez-faire economy as well as socially conservative principles (for instance, Christian family values). Since classical liberal institutions were gradually accepted by conservatives, there is very little to distinguish liberal conservatives from conservative liberals.[7]. Neoconservatism has also been identified as an ideological relative or twin to conservative liberalism,[8] and some similarities exist also between conservative liberalism and national liberalism.[9][10].
Thought 5: Conservative liberalism or right-liberalism is a variant of liberalism, combining liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or simply representing the right-wing of the liberal movement. So the answer is Conservative liberalism.

Adolf Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters.[1] The film contains excerpts of speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Its overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power with Hitler as its leader. The film was produced after the Night of the Long Knives and many formerly prominent SA members are absent..

The film received positive reviews and was nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature. A sequel is in the works and is scheduled to be released in late 2023.. The film examines the modern food industry, and raises alarms about both the industrial production of meat (chicken, beef, and pork) and the modern methods used to grow grains and vegetables (primarily corn and soybeans).

A photo of him emerging distraught from his vehicle[1] was printed in world newspapers.[2][3] The reason for the shooting was never fully established. Time magazine suggested that the soldiers were "nervous".[4] The film was shot by BBC cameraman Ernest Christie.. David Van Reybrouck, a Belgian historian whose father was employed by Nouvelle Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Bas-Congo au Katanga (B.C.K.) and who was an eye-witness to the scene from his apartment window, wrote that the Indian U.N. troops might have mistaken Verbrugghe and his company for "white mercenaries".[5] Only when the dead bodies of the two women and the dog were laid down in the grass besides the road, Verbrugghe seemed to realize what had happened.

In the early Christian era it came to be associated with the Greek adjective καθαρός (katharos), meaning "pure", leading to the alternative spellings Katharine and Katherine. The former spelling, with a middle a, was more common in the past and is currently[when?] more popular in the United States than in Britain. Katherine, with a middle e, was first recorded in England in 1196 after being brought back from the Crusades.[1].

Observation 2: Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid DBE RA (Arabic: زها حديد Zahā Ḥadīd; 31 October 1950 – 31 March 2016) was an Iraqi-British architect, artist and designer, recognised as a major figure in architecture of the late-20th and early-21st centuries. Born in Baghdad, Iraq,[1] Hadid studied mathematics as an undergraduate and then enrolled at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in 1972. In search of an alternative system to traditional architectural drawing, and influenced by Suprematism and the Russian avant-garde, Hadid adopted painting as a design tool and abstraction as an investigative principle to "reinvestigate the aborted and untested experiments of Modernism [...] to unveil new fields of building."[2]. She was described by The Guardian as the "Queen of the curve",[3] who "liberated architectural geometry, giving it a whole new expressive identity".[4]  Her major works include the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Olympics, the Broad Art Museum, Rome's MAXXI Museum, and the Guangzhou Opera House.[5] Some of her awards have been presented posthumously, including the statuette for the 2017 Brit Awards. Several of her buildings were still under construction at the time of her death, including the Daxing International Airport in Beijing, and the Al Wakrah Stadium (now Al Janoub) in Qatar, a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[6][7][8].

The High Plains are located in eastern Montana, southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico.[4] The southern region of the Western High Plains ecology region contains the geological formation known as Llano Estacado which can be seen from a short distance or on satellite maps.[5] From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]. The term "Great Plains", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States,[6] brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Prior to 1916, the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.[7] Today the term "High Plains" is usually used for a subregion instead of the whole of the Great Plains..

There are several versions of the myth in which she appears, but the general narrative, found in Greco-Roman mythology, is that due to a curse made by the fierce wrath of the god Cupid, son of Venus, on the god Apollo (Phoebus), she became the unwilling object of the infatuation of Apollo, who chased her against her wishes. Just before being kissed by him, Daphne invoked her river god father, who transformed her into a laurel tree, thus foiling Apollo.. Thenceforth Apollo developed a special reverence for laurel.

Soldiers were garrisoned along the line of the wall in large forts, smaller milecastles and intervening turrets.[2] In addition to the wall's defensive military role, its gates may have been customs posts.[3].

Despite the Wii U sharing a similar name as its predecessor, the Wii, the emulator was built independently from Dolphin, a Wii emulator, as the systems only shared their CPU architecture in common.[10] The emulator would rapidly progress from this state and increase its compatibility with the Wii U game library and add more features.. A couple of days after The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild released, Cemu was able to boot the game - though running at a sluggish framerate, without audio, and filled with many glitches.

47527 Question: How long was the revolution period existed which strongly influenced Ottomanism?Thought 1: I need to search Ottomanism, find the revolution period which strongly influenced Ottomanism, then find the length of the revolution period.
Action 1: Search[Ottomanism]
Observation 1: Ottomanism or Osmanlılık (Ottoman Turkish: عثمانلولق, Turkish: Osmanlıcılık) was a concept which developed prior to the 1876–1878 First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could create the social cohesion needed to keep millets from tearing the empire apart.[1]. Thinkers such as Montesquieu (1689–1755) and Rousseau (1712–1778), as well as the events of the French Revolution of 1789, strongly influenced Ottomanism. It promoted equality among the millets. The idea of Ottomanism originated amongst the Young Ottomans (founded in 1865) in concepts such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e., all were to be "Ottomans" with equal rights.

Observation 2: The French Revolution (French: Révolution française [ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz]) was a period of radical political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[1] while the values and institutions it created remain central to French political discourse.[2]. Its causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien Régime proved unable to manage. In May 1789, widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. Continuing unrest culminated in the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, the imposition of state control over the Catholic Church in France, and extension of the right to vote..
Thought 3: The French Revolution of 1789 lasted from May 1789 to November 1799, so the answer is 10 years.

Prison films have been asserted to be "guilty of oversimplifying complex issues, the end result of which is the proliferation of stereotypes".[1] For example, they are said to perpetuate "a common misperception that most correctional officers are abusive", and that prisoners are "violent and beyond redemption".[1]. Themes repeatedly visited in the prison films include escape attempts, gang activities inside the prison, efforts of wrongly convicted persons to prove their innocence, and guard and management cruelty. An entire subgenre of films exists where the toughest prisoners are permitted (or forced) to engage in boxing matches or martial arts bouts, replete with high-stakes wagering on the outcomes.

Action 1: Search[Boulevard Solitude]
Observation 1: Boulevard Solitude is a Lyrisches Drama (lyric drama) or opera in one act by Hans Werner Henze to a German libretto by Grete Weil after the play by Walter Jockisch, in its turn a modern retelling of Abbé Prévost's 1731 novel Manon Lescaut. The piece is a reworking of the Manon Lescaut story, already adapted operatically by Auber, Massenet and Puccini, and here relocated to Paris after World War II where, as is noted in Grove, the focus of the story moves away from Manon and towards Armand des Grieux.[1] It became Henze's first fully-fledged opera.[1] The work stands out for its strong jazz influences, from a composer who had hitherto been associated with twelve-tone technique.. The premiere was given on 17 February 1952, at the Landestheater Hannover.. Although it never became part of the core operatic repertoire, Boulevard Solitude continued to receive performances after the premiere. It was given in both Naples and Rome in 1954 and it received its UK premiere in London by the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells in 1962 where the cast included Peter Glossop and April Cantelo.[1] The first performance in the United States was at the Santa Fe Opera in 1967..

Suardon (Nicola Daspuro) (with additions by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti), based on the French novel L'ami Fritz by Émile Erckmann and Pierre-Alexandre Chatrian.. While the opera enjoyed some success in its day and is probably Mascagni's most famous work after Cavalleria rusticana, today it is performed far more rarely than Cavalleria, which remains Mascagni's only enduringly popular work outside Italy, where L'amico Fritz and Iris are still in the active repertoire. The "Cherry Duet" between Fritz and Suzel in Act 2 is the best known piece in the opera and is often performed separately in concert.. The opera was first performed in Rome at the Teatro Costanzi, on 31 October 1891.
Thought 3: L'amico Fritz is an opera in three acts, so it has more acts than Boulevard Solitude.

Observation 7: Genre (from French  genre 'kind, or sort'[1]) is any form or type of communication in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time.[2] In popular usage, it normally describes a category of literature, music, or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones.[3] Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.. Genre began[clarification needed] as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature, as set out in Aristotle's Poetics.[4] For Aristotle, poetry (odes, epics, etc.), prose, and performance each had specific design features that supported appropriate content of each genre.

Observation 2: Van Partible (born Efrem Giovanni Bravo Partible;[1] December 13, 1971) is a Filipino-born American animator, storyboard artist, director, writer and producer best known for creating the animated television series Johnny Bravo.. Partible was born in Manila but moved to the United States when he was nine months old.[2][3] He grew up in Salinas, California with an avid love of drawing.[1][3][4] Despite growing up copying artwork from collections of old comic books, it was not until college that Partible decided to pursue a career in animation.[4] Partible attended Loyola Marymount University where he began work on a senior thesis project titled Mess O' Blues (1993).[1] Initially a film about three Elvis Presley impersonators, the short time to produce the cartoon influenced Partible to shorten it to one.[2][5]. Upon graduation in 1993, Partible was 22 and did not have the extensive experience and portfolio that studios were looking for, and for a while worked in a daycare program for a local elementary school.[4] Mess O' Blues was shown by Partible's animation professor, Dan McLaughlin, to a friend working for Hanna-Barbera Cartoons.[1] The studio loved the film and asked Partible to do a pitch for a seven-minute cartoon based on it – what would become Johnny Bravo.[2][6]. The short was produced for Cartoon Network's new animation showcase titled World Premiere Toons.[1][5] Partible initially roomed with Craig McCracken (creator of The Powerpuff Girls, Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends, and Wander Over Yonder), Paul Rudish (a designer on that series) and Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, and Star Wars: Clone Wars).[5] The only two cartoonists who worked at Hanna-Barbera fresh out of college were Partible and Seth MacFarlane (creator of Family Guy, American Dad!, and The Cleveland Show).[5] Partible changed his character from Mess O' Blues around so that "he would be more of this '50's iconic James Dean-looking character that talked like Elvis". Partible picked voice actor Jeff Bennett to play Johnny Bravo solely based on his young, hyped Elvis impression.[5].

Ulrich von Hassell, a German diplomat who served as ambassador to Italy from 1932 to 1938, had emerged as one of the leaders of the conservative opposition to the Nazi regime.[5] During the Phoney War, Hassell sought an "assurance" from Britain that an "honorable peace" would be obtainable for a post-Nazi German government.[5] Lonsdale-Bryans, described to Hassell as "an English associate of Lord Halifax", was prominent in the high society of Rome and had let it be known that he was willing to serve as an amateur diplomat.[5] Lonsdale-Bryans had moved to Rome in October 1939 and, in November 1939 first met Count Detalmo Biroli.[6] In his 1951 book The Blind Victory, Lonsdale-Bryans wrote of his "self-appointed mission" as "winning the peace" and "saving millions of lives", but the German historian Gregor Schöllgen described Lonsdale-Bryans's real motives as seeking fame and money via his "often eccentric" attempts at playing diplomat.[6].

Action 2: Search[Royal Banner of Scotland]
Observation 2: The Royal Banner of the Royal Arms of Scotland,[1] also known as the Royal Banner of Scotland,[2][3] or more commonly the Lion Rampant of Scotland,[4] and historically as the Royal Standard of Scotland, (Scottish Gaelic: Bratach rìoghail na h-Alba, Scots: Ryal banner o Scotland) or Banner of the King of Scots,[5] is the royal banner of Scotland, and historically, the royal standard of the Kingdom of Scotland.[6] Used historically by the Scottish monarchs, the banner differs from Scotland's national flag, the Saltire, in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent the Monarchy in Scotland.[6] It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Head of State is not present.[7]. The earliest recorded use of the Lion Rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222;[8] with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286).[8] This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which, together with a royal banner displaying the same, was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI acceded to the thrones of the kingdoms of England and Ireland.[9] Since 1603, the lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland, as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom.[10] Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Monarch and at royal residences, the Royal Banner continues to be one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.[11]. Displaying a red and black lion rampant, with blue tongue and claws, within a red double border on a yellow background, the design of the Royal Banner of Scotland is formally specified in heraldry as: Or, a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter-flory of the second,[12] meaning: A gold (Or) background, whose principal symbol is a red (Gules) upright lion (lion rampant) with blue (Azure) claws and tongue (armed and langued), surrounded by a two-lined border (tressure) decorated with opposing pairs of floral symbols (flory counter-flory) of the second colour specified in the blazon (Gules). Used as a house flag, its proportions are 5:4;[13] however, flag manufacturers themselves may also adopt alternative ratios, including 1:2 or 2:3.[14]. The Lion rampant has been used as a heraldic symbol by heirs of Malcolm III beginning with David I.

Action 1: Search[Portuguese explorer]
Observation 1: Portuguese maritime exploration resulted in the numerous territories and maritime routes recorded by the Portuguese as a result of their intensive maritime journeys during the 15th and 16th centuries. Portuguese sailors were at the vanguard of European exploration, chronicling and mapping the coasts of Africa and Asia, then known as the East Indies, and Canada and Brazil (the West Indies), in what came to be known as the Age of Discovery.. Methodical expeditions started in 1419 along West Africa's coast under the sponsorship of prince Henry the Navigator, with Bartolomeu Dias reaching the Cape of Good Hope and entering the Indian Ocean in 1488. Ten years later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama led the first fleet around Africa to India, arriving in Calicut and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Portuguese explorations then proceeded to southeast Asia, where they reached Japan in 1542, forty-four years after their first arrival in India.[1] In 1500, the Portuguese nobleman Pedro Álvares Cabral became the first European to discover Brazil.[2].

He was the first human in history to ever be in 4 continents, uniting all of them in his famous voyage of 1500, where he also conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of South America and claimed it for Portugal. While details of Cabral's early life remain unclear, it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education. He was appointed to head an expedition to India in 1500, following Vasco da Gama's newly-opened route around Africa. The undertaking had the aim of returning with valuable spices and of establishing trade relations in India—bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of Arab, Turkish and Italian merchants.

Native Americans used the river as transportation route and portage. When French explorers and missionaries arrived in the 1600s, in what was then the Illinois Country of New France, they named the waterway La Rivière des Plaines (River of the Plane Tree) as they felt that trees on the river resembled the European plane tree.[citation needed]  The local Native Americans showed these early European explorers how to traverse waterways of the Des Plaines watershed to travel from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River and its valley.. Parts of the river are now part of the Illinois Waterway and the Chicago Area Waterway System.. The slow-moving Des Plaines River rises in southern Wisconsin just west of Kenosha adjacent to the Great Lakes Dragway and flows southward primarily through marshland as it crosses into Illinois.

MVA homes are marketed in the US by Maharishi Global Construction, LLC (MGC),[9] in Fairfield, Iowa, and by MVA Homes in the UK, both arms of the Transcendental Meditation movement.

The circumscription of the genus has varied greatly. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the widely-used broad circumscription was polyphyletic, so most of its hundreds of species have been reassigned to other genera.[6][7] Molecular analyses have recovered five polyphyletic clades of Schefflera, all of which are geographically isolated from one another yet share similar traits indicating parallel evolution.[8] These clades have been split into separate genera, primarily along geographical lines, with Schefflera now consisting of thirteen species restricted to New Zealand and some Pacific islands.[9][10][11].

Action 2: Search[History of Albany, New York (prehistory–1664)]
Observation 2: The history of Albany, New York prior to 1664 begins with the native inhabitants of the area and ends in 1664, with the English takeover of New Netherland. The area was originally inhabited by Algonquian Indian tribes and was given different names by the various peoples. The Mohican called it Pempotowwuthut-Muhhcanneuw, meaning "the fireplace of the Mohican nation",[1] while the Iroquois called it Sche-negh-ta-da, or "through the pine woods".[2][Note 1] Albany's first European structure was a primitive fort on Castle Island built by French traders in 1540. It was destroyed by flooding soon after construction.[4]. Permanent European claims began when Englishman Henry Hudson, exploring for the Dutch East India Company on the Half Moon (Dutch: Halve Maen), reached the area in 1609, claiming it for the United Netherlands.[5] In 1614, Hendrick Christiaensen rebuilt the French fort as Fort Nassau, the first Dutch fur trading post in present-day Albany.[6] Commencement of the fur trade provoked hostility from the French colony in Canada and amongst the natives, all of whom vied to control the trade.

In 1632, a fortification was constructed on Fort Hill to defend the town.[4][5][6] In 1634, Boston sought defenses farther out in the harbor, on one of the numerous islands which protected the port.[7] In July 1634, the town decided to build a fortification on Castle Island.[7][8] Deputy Governor Roger Ludlow and Captain John Mason of Dorchester supervised construction of the fort.[7] After a structure was built on the northeast side of the island, the General Court resolved that the fort at Castle Island should be completed before any other fortification was begun.[4][7] The fort was later known as Castle William and required incoming ships to recognize the fortification and would fire at them if they didn't offer recognition by raising their flag.[9][10]. After the end of the King Philip's War the fortress was a site of internment of captured Native Americans who were shipped out to be sold into the Atlantic slave trade markets.[11]. By the end of the century, the fort had been expanded to create a crossfire with the fort on Governor's Island.[10].

Observation 5: The National Front was a far-right party in Switzerland that flourished during the 1930s. At its peak the group had as many as 9,000 members, according to the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland,[1] and "may have had a membership of 25,000 or so", according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.[2] The party was financed by the Reich Ministry of Propaganda. It became defunct in 1940 and was banned by the Swiss Federal Council in 1943.[1]. The party began life amongst a number of debating clubs at ETH Zurich, where antisemitism, Swiss nationalism and support for ideas similar to those later adopted in the racial policy of Nazi Germany had become popular among some of the young academics.[3] A number of these groups (all of which co-operated in a loose federation) were formally brought together by Robert Tobler in 1930 to form the Neue Front[4] although this group was not fully committed to fascism.[3] A more radical group, under the leadership of Hans Vonwyl, broke away in the autumn of 1930 to establish the National Front, which aimed to expand its operations outside the university.[3]. Initially the National Front did not grow far outside the confines of the University but soon the party newspaper, Der Eiserne Besen (The Iron Broom), became widely read and its antisemitic message found an audience.[3] Chaired by Ernst Biedermann,[5] the group experienced growth and in April 1933 formed an alliance with the Neue Front which, under the leadership of Tobler, Paul Lang and Hans Oehler, had itself radicalised and become more open to fascism.[6] The National Front absorbed its counterpart the following month although the Neue Front leadership quickly took charge of the combined movement, with Rolf Henne emerging as chairman.[6] Emil Sonderegger, a former member of the Swiss General Staff, was a prominent speaker and propagandist of the National Front at this time.[7] The party continued to grow and soon won seats on Zürich council, as well as the support of well-known Swiss writers of the time, such as Jakob Schaffner.[2] In all they held 10 seats on Zürich municipal council following the September 1933 election.[6] Ernst Leonhardt, the party's organiser in the North-West, left soon after this after an internal dispute but the move had no impact on the growth of the Front, with a party newspaper, Die Front, established soon afterwards.[8] By 1935 the party claimed 10,000 members.[8].

Liszt first gained renown during the early nineteenth century for his virtuoso skill as a pianist.[2] Regarded as one of the greatest pianists of all time, he toured Europe during the 1830s and 1840s, often playing for charity.[3] In these years, Liszt developed a reputation for his powerful performances as well as his physical attractiveness.[4] In what has now been dubbed "Lisztomania", he rose to a degree of stardom and popularity among the public not experienced by the virtuosos who preceded him. Whereas earlier performers mostly served the upper class, Liszt attracted a more general audience.[5][6] During this period and into his later life, Liszt was a friend, musical promoter and benefactor to many composers of his time, including Frédéric Chopin, Charles-Valentin Alkan, Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Robert Schumann, Clara Schumann, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg, Ole Bull, Joachim Raff, Mikhail Glinka, and Alexander Borodin.[7].

In 2006, the centennial of Ibsen's death, A Doll's House held the distinction of being the world's most performed play that year.[4] UNESCO has inscribed Ibsen's autographed manuscripts of A Doll's House on the Memory of the World Register in 2001, in recognition of their historical value.[5].

The Flint Hills Ecoregion is designated as a distinct region because it has the densest coverage of intact tallgrass prairie in North America. Due to its rocky soil, the early settlers were unable to plow the area, resulting in the prevalence of cattle ranches as opposed to the crop land more typical of the Great Plains. These ranches rely on annual controlled burns conducted by ranchers every spring to renew the prairie grasses for cattle to graze..

The Woman Voter was created in 1909 in order to keep members of the Woman Suffrage Party (WSP) informed about party activities, updated with pertinent news and editorials relating to women's suffrage.[1] The back of the publication included a "membership blank" to help increase the size of the WSP.[5] Beard started as editor of the journal in 1910.[6] With Beard's leadership, the Voter expanded its offerings, providing longer articles, stories about workers, and also stories for children about suffrage.[7] Beard also gave room in the Voter for the opinions of trade unionist, Leonora O'Reilly.[8] The author of 'The Woman Voter' was Vida Goldstein, a feminist and a suffragist.. Beard quit as editor in April 1912, and the new editor became Florence Woolston.[9] Woolston continued running the journal in a manner similar to Beard.[9]. In January 1913, The Woman Voter negotiated to merge with the newsletter of the New York State chapter of the National Woman Suffrage Association, and after 1913 and for a year, the journal was known as The Woman Voter and the Newsletter.[9] In 1914, Voter reverted to its original name and focused heavily on the upcoming vote for women's suffrage in 1915.[10]. When women did not get the vote in 1915, Woolston "returned the Voter to its broader mission."[10] Voter began to focus on the new vote for suffrage taking place in New York in November 1917, however, the publication had its last issue in May 1917 and then was merged into the Woman's Journal and The National Suffrage News.[10] The new publication was called The Woman Citizen.[10].

Roxanne Quimby, a co-founder of US company Burt's Bees, and her foundation, Elliotsville Plantation, Inc., began purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 before formally announcing their plans in 2011 that the land would one day become part of a national park.[4][5] However, following opposition by state and federal politicians to the creation of a national park, Quimby changed her focus to a national monument, which could be created with a proclamation by the president under the Antiquities Act.[6] On August 23, 2016, Elliotsville Plantation and the Quimby Family Foundation donated the land (valued at $60 million), plus $20 million to fund initial operations and a commitment of $20 million in future support, to the federal government.[7] On August 24, 2016, the eve of the National Park Service centennial, President Barack Obama proclaimed 87,563 acres (137 sq mi) of land as the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument.[8]. In December, 2020, the Park Service received funding to purchase an additional 3,000–4,000 acres (4.7–6.3 sq mi) of land.[9]. Many people opposed the monument, with some concerned about federal intrusion into the lands of Northern Maine.

In Week 16, Drew Brees broke the single-season passing record previously held by Dan Marino; Brees ended the season with 5,476 passing yards, an NFL record.[1] The team also broke the record for offensive yards from scrimmage with 7,474 and Darren Sproles broke the record for all purpose yards, with 2,696. The Saints also finished second in scoring for total points with 547, and finished second for points per game with 34.2 points and sacks with 24.[2][3]. The Saints improved on their 11–5 finish from a season earlier and won the NFC South Division with a 13–3 record, and went undefeated at home, so there was much talk of the Saints potentially winning a second Super Bowl in three seasons.

Observation 3: Capsicum (/ˈkæpsɪkəm/[3]) is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae, native to the Americas, cultivated worldwide for their chili pepper or bell pepper fruit.. The generic name may come from Latin capsa, meaning 'box', presumably alluding to the pods;[4][5] or possibly from the Greek word κάπτω kapto, 'to gulp'.[6] The name "pepper" comes from the similarity of piquance (spiciness or "heat") of the flavor to that of black pepper, Piper nigrum,[dubious  – discuss] although there is no botanical relationship with it or with Sichuan pepper. The original term, chilli (now chile in Mexico) came from the Nahuatl word chīlli, denoting a larger Capsicum variety cultivated at least since 3000 BC, as evidenced by remains found in pottery from Puebla and Oaxaca.[7] Different varieties were cultivated in South America, where they are known as ajíes (singular ají), from the Quechua term for Capsicum.. The fruit (technically berries in the strict botanical sense) of Capsicum plants have a variety of names depending on place and type. The more piquant varieties are commonly called chili peppers, or simply chilis.

Observation 3: Samuel Osmond Barber II (March 9, 1910 – January 23, 1981) was an American composer, pianist, conductor, baritone, and music educator, and one of the most celebrated composers of the 20th century. The music critic Donal Henahan said, "Probably no other American composer has ever enjoyed such early, such persistent and such long-lasting acclaim."[1] Principally influenced by nine years' composition studies with Rosario Scalero at the Curtis Institute and more than 25 years' study with his uncle, the composer Sidney Homer, Barber's music usually eschewed the experimental trends of musical modernism in favor of traditional 19th-century harmonic language and formal structure embracing lyricism and emotional expression. However, he adopted elements of modernism after 1940 in some of his compositions, such as an increased use of dissonance and chromaticism in the Cello Concerto (1945) and Medea's Dance of Vengeance (1955); and the use of tonal ambiguity and a narrow use of serialism in his Piano Sonata (1949), Prayers of Kierkegaard (1954), and Nocturne (1959).. Barber was adept at both instrumental and vocal music. His works became successful on the international stage and many of his compositions enjoyed rapid adoption into the classical performance canon.

More than one quarter of Kahoʻolawe has been eroded down to saprolitic hardpan soil, largely on exposed surfaces near the summit..

Action 1: Search[Indian reservation]
Observation 1: An Indian reservation is an area of land held and governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation whose government is accountable to the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs and not to the state government in which it is located. Some of the country's 574[3] federally recognized tribes govern more than one of the 326[1] Indian reservations in the United States, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. Historical piecemeal land allocations under the Dawes Act facilitated sales to non–Native Americans, resulting in some reservations becoming severely fragmented, with pieces of tribal and privately held land being treated as separate enclaves. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.[4]. The total area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2),[1] approximately 2.3% of the total area of the United States and about the size of the state of Idaho.

They are located on the Crow Indian Reservation and the Custer National Forest, and portions of them are on private land.[2] They lie south of Billings, Montana, and north of Lovell, Wyoming.[2]. The mountains are named for Sergeant Nathaniel Hale Pryor, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition who vainly pursued horses stolen from the expedition in the area.[3] The Crow Nation, a Native American tribe which lived nearby, called the mountains Baahpuuo Isawaxaawuua ("Hitting Rock Mountains") because of the abundance of flint there (which was chipped into arrowheads).[4]. According to Crow Nation folklore, Little People (a race of 18-inch (46 cm) high dwarf-like people with spiritual powers) lived in these mountains.[5]. The Pryor Mountains are a 145,000-square-mile (380,000 km2) region of Montana and Wyoming.[6] The Pryor Mountains consists of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks[7] the most prominent unit is limestone (known as the Madison Group limestone) laid down about 300 million years ago.[8][9]  The limestone and older sediments rest on Archean metamorphic rock consisting of gneiss and schists.[7] The gneiss is exposed along the northeast escarpment of East Pryor Mountain.[7]  During the Laramide orogeny in the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene Period (about 70 to 60 million years ago),[10] the limestone was faulted and uplifted.

Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as heroic.

Many years later, in 1898, Giuseppe Verdi "praised the broad curves of Bellini's melody: 'there are extremely long melodies as no-one else had ever made before'."[4]. A large amount of what is known about Bellini's life and his activities comes from surviving letters—except for a short period—which were written over his lifetime to his friend Francesco Florimo, whom he had met as a fellow student in Naples and with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. Other sources of information come from correspondence saved by other friends and business acquaintances.. Bellini was the quintessential composer of the Italian bel canto era of the early 19th century, and his work has been summed up by the London critic Tim Ashley as:.

The majority of smock mills are octagonal in plan,[1] with a lesser number hexagonal in plan, such as Killick's Mill, Meopham.[2] A very small number of smock mills were decagonal or dodecagonal in plan, an example of the latter being at Wicken, Cambridgeshire.[3].

The drink is generally served with ice – sometimes in an old-fashioned glass or a Collins glass, and sometimes in less-expensive containers such as disposable plastic cups.[1] When bourbon is used, it is often called bourbon and Coke, or more generically, bourbon and cola. The "Coke" part of the name may tend to imply that the Coca-Cola brand of cola is used, but it is common for any brand of cola to be referred to as "Coke", at least in the American South.[1][2].
Thought 2: Jack and Coke does not use lemon rind as garnish. I need to search Pink Gin.
Action 2: Search[Pink Gin]
Observation 2: Pink gin was historically used to reference a type of cocktail[1] made fashionable in England in the mid-19th century, consisting of Plymouth gin[2] and a dash of Angostura bitters, a dark red bitters that makes the whole drink pinkish. In recent years, the term Pink gin has also been used to define a specific category of gin where a range of fruits and flavourings are infused into the gin to give it a pink color.[3]. Lemon rind is also commonly used as a garnish, with the citrus essential oils subtly complementing the flavour.. Pink gin is widely thought to have been created by members of the Royal Navy. Plymouth gin is a 'sweet' gin, as opposed to London gin which is 'dry', and was added to Angostura bitters to make the consumption of Angostura bitters more enjoyable[4] as they were used as a treatment for sea sickness in 1824 by Dr.
Thought 3: Pink Gin uses lemon rind as garnish. So the answer is Pink Gin.

Observation 1: In mathematical logic, a first-order Gödel logic is a member of a family of finite- or infinite-valued logics in which the sets of truth values V are closed subsets of the interval [0,1] containing both 0 and 1. Different such sets V in general determine different Gödel logics. The concept is named after Kurt Gödel.[1]. This mathematical logic-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it..
Thought 2: The concept is named after Kurt Gödel. So I need to search Kurt Gödel and find his original nationality.
Action 2: Search[Kurt Gödel]
Observation 2: Kurt Friedrich Gödel (/ˈɡɜːrdəl/ GUR-dəl,[2] German: [kʊʁt ˈɡøːdl̩] (listen); April 28, 1906 – January 14, 1978) was a  logician, mathematician, and philosopher. Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell,[3] Alfred North Whitehead,[3] and David Hilbert were using logic and set theory to investigate the foundations of mathematics, building on earlier work by the likes of Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor and Frege.. Gödel's discoveries in the foundations of mathematics led to the proof of Gödel's completeness theorem in 1929 as part of his dissertation to earn a doctorate at the University of Vienna, and the publication of the two Gödel's incompleteness theorems two years later, in 1931. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any ω-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example, Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the natural numbers that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms.[4] To prove this, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. The second incompleteness theorem, which follows from the first, states that the system cannot prove its own consistency.[5].
Thought 3: Kurt Gödel was a logician, mathematician, and philosopher from Austria. So the answer is Austria.
Action 3: Finish[Austria]

The original nationality of the namesake of Gödel logic is Austria.

It is located southeast of the Gobi Desert and is surrounded by the Yellow River. It includes parts of the Chinese provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi and Shanxi.[1] The depositional setting of the Chinese Loess Plateau was shaped by the tectonic movement in the Neogene period, after which strong southeast winds caused by the East Asian Monsoon transported sediment to the plateau during the Quaternary period.[2] The three main morphological types in the Loess Plateau are loess platforms, ridges and hills,[1] formed by the deposition and erosion of loess. Most of the loess comes from the Gobi Desert and other nearby deserts.[3] The sediments were transported to the Loess Plateau during interglacial periods by southeasterly prevailing winds and winter monsoon winds. After the deposition of sediments on the plateau, they were gradually compacted to form loess under the arid climate.[1].

The EU has often been described as a sui generis political entity (without precedent or comparison) combining the characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.[9][10]. Containing 5.8 per cent of the world population in 2020,[c] the EU generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around US$17.1 trillion in 2021,[5] constituting approximately 18 per cent of global nominal GDP.[12] Additionally, all EU states but Bulgaria have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme.

This principle was at the heart of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) (1951), the Treaty of Paris (1951), and later the Treaty of Rome (1958) which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC).

Dick.[4]  The collection featured "Foetal Attractions" which won second prize in the "Roadworks 2000 Short Story Competition"[5] and two of the stories in the collection, "It" and "Blue" later garnered honorable mentions in that year's "The Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror".[6] HellNotes described the collection as "Odd, unique, very cool, and extremely readable"[7] while Horror World described Burr as "not merely a “new” voice, he is a fresh voice – a different and disturbing voice - and one deserving of your attention.".[8]   His work has often been described as Bizarro fiction[9][10][11] although he has no direct links to the group of writers working under that banner.. His work echoes that of early J.G.Ballard with its fascination with the mundane grittiness of the concrete underpass or the wet tarmac street, but it also has similarities with the surreal satirical works of Will Self, and the reality-questioning works of Cartesian doubt for which Philip K. Dick was so well known.

9162 Question: Which was published first, Oceans or Don Quixote?Thought 1: I need to search Oceans and Don Quixote, then compare their publication dates.
Action 1: Search[Oceans]
Observation 1: The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that makes approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface area and contains 97% of Earth's water.[1] An ocean can also refer to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided.[2] Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest).[3][4] Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle.. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean.
Thought 2: I need to search Don Quixote instead.
Action 2: Search[Don Quixote]
Observation 2: Don Quixote[a][b] is a Spanish epic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, its full title is The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha or, in Spanish, El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote[b] de la Mancha (changing in Part 2 to El ingenioso caballero don Quixote[b] de la Mancha).[c] A founding work of Western literature, it is often labelled as the first modern novel[2][3] and one of the greatest works ever written.[4][5] Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated books in the world[6] and the best-selling novel of all time.. The plot revolves around the adventures of a member of the lowest nobility, an hidalgo from La Mancha named Alonso Quijano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he either loses or pretends to have lost his mind in order to become a knight-errant (caballero andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha.[b] He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's lofty rhetoric often concerning knighthood, already seeming old-fashioned at the time or incoherent to most, and representing the most droll realism in contrast to his master's idealism though at times left being very impressed. In the first part of the book, Don Quixote does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story that's meant for the annals of all time.. The book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers (1844), Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (1897),[citation needed] as well as the word quixotic..
Thought 3: Don Quixote was published first in 1605 and 1615, while Oceans is not a book.

But Ophüls takes the book as a starting point for exploring the possibility of people judging one another, especially in light of their behavior in other contexts, as well as dealing with individual versus collective responsibility.[1] The film discusses the notion that any group in power is capable of committing a war atrocity.. The film had a difficult genesis.

Standard operating procedure for many roads departments is to route any detour over roads within the same jurisdiction as the road with the obstructed area.[1]. On multi-lane highways (e.g., freeways, expressways, city streets, etc.), usually traffic shifts can replace a detour, as detours often congest turn lanes.[citation needed].

Observation 4: The Natural is a 1952 novel about baseball by Bernard Malamud, and is his debut novel. The story follows Roy Hobbs, a baseball prodigy whose career is sidetracked after being shot by a woman whose motivation remains mysterious. The story mostly concerns his attempts to return to baseball later in life, when he plays for the fictional New York Knights with his self-made bat "Wonderboy".. Based upon the bizarre shooting incident and subsequent comeback of Philadelphia Phillies player Eddie Waitkus,[2] the story of Roy Hobbs takes some poetic license and embellishes what was truly a strange, but memorable, account of a career lost too soon. Apart from the fact that both Waitkus and fictional Hobbs were shot by women, there are few if any other similarities.

Based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the same name and the first of his 17 operas, Der Bärenhäuter received its premiere on 22 January 1899 at the National Theatre Munich.[3]. In the spring of 1895 Siegfried Wagner learned about Engelbert Humperdinck's idea of setting two related fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm, "Bearskin" and "The Devil's Sooty Brother", to music. When Humperdinck abandoned the notion, Wagner became inspired to pursue the project.. With musical themes in mind, Wagner began composing the overture in early 1896. In comparison to the preludes and overtures of his contemporaries, such as Eugen d'Albert, Engelbert Humperdinck and Richard Strauss, his overture's playing time of 14 minutes ranks equally as extensive as his peers' works.
